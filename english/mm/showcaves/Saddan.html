        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Saddan Cave</b> is a buddhist cave temple with hundreds of small Buddha statues and a few big ones.
            There are even some pagodas erected inside the huge entrance hall.
            Highlights are a reclining Buddha statue and a natural rock which has a Buddha face.
            To enter the temple it is necessary to leave your shoes at the entrance.
            On the tiled floor of the temple this is no big thing, but at the end of the temple the show cave starts.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A concrete trail with iron railing leads down a main passage with thousands of bats.
            The floor is wet and slippery with bat guano.
            You remember what we said about the shoes?
            Yuck.
            We suggest to take the shoes with you in a bag, so you can put them on after the temple.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The through cave takes about 20 to 30 minutes.
            The temple is well lit, but the cave behind is sometimes a bit dark, so you should bring a lamp.
            On the other end of the cave is a small jetty with wooden canoes.
            For a fee the boats bring you back to the entrance.
            If you pay the regular fee you have to wait until the boat is full, it seats four people, or you can pay for four and get your own boat.
            Depending on the time of year the lakes might be dried out, and you have to walk back.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The way back is almost more interesting than the way in.
            The boats return through a second cave, a river cave, which connects two lakes on opposite sides of the karst tower..
            From the jetty you can see a vertical cliff face with a dark ledge at the bottom.
            When you get closer see that it is a cave which is only 3 m high but at least 15 m wide.
            This passage, while natural, looks almost like a concrete sewage tube.
            The boats cross the cave to the lake on the other side.
            From there a canal was built around the karst tower to irrigate the fields.
            From the end of the canal it's only a short walk to the parking lot.
        </p>

Bat Cave
The bats are leaving this cave every evening before sunset.



https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hpa-an#Do

Kaw Ka Taung Cave (Follow the main road east (it turns southeast later) from the Clock Tower for 10.5 km).
This is a small and low cave built using tiles and filled with numerous small and big Buddhas.
Bring a torch since there is something in the end to explore.
Going further just by the cave, after 200 m there is a nice swimming pool with very clear water from the mountain and hundreds of fish in it, circled by half a dozen restaurants right next to beautiful rice fields.
Take a swim and get off the salt.

Kaw Goon Cave (After crossing the bridge towards Thaton go left/southwest and drive 3.8 km until the end of the road.).
Besides the Saddan Cave, this is also a very famous cave and worth the visit, causing the steep price.
The rock carvings are said to originate from the 13th century.
If you are not keen to pay the entrance, climb the close lookout for free.
It may be possible to skip the "donation" check by keeping to the left and walking behind the buildings facing the main path.
Watch out for the monkeys. 3,000 kyat "donation".
Kaw Goon Cave (Q19696742) on Wikidata (updated Jan 2019 | edit)
11 Ya-The-Byan Cave (On the road towards Kaw Goon Cave from the bridge after 2.5 km take the road to the west, straight for another 2.5 km). The entrance to this cave is 116 feet above sea level. Stemming back from the 17th century. With three Buddha images (standing and sitting), nearly 5 feet in height. It is located close to the village with the same name. Top of the hill exit has an amazing sunset view deck. edit

Hpa-An bat cave at sunset
12 Bat Cave (9 km away from the city. Take the first "road" to the right directly after the end of the bridge towards Thaton before the control point. Keep driving until you're close to the river and turn left at the T junction (there should be a sign). Drive until the gate and walk the rest until the end passing by the temple. Be especially careful when driving back in the dark.). This is a great experience and impressive nature spectacle when an endless stream of 100,000s of bats come flying out of their cave at sunset (check the sunset time for your dates, it can be between 17:20 in November to 18:40 in July). The bats start coming out of the cave almost exactly at sunset, and the whole spectacle takes more than 1 hr (although the vast majority of the flying mammals fly out of the cave in the first 10 min). Bring patience and a torch (for the walk back). Go a bit earlier and climb up the nearby hill in front of the cave with a stupa on top to have a stunning view of the river and countryside. The best place to see the bats is near the stupa at the base of the stairs. About 5,000 kyat for a taxi to get there and back from Hpa-an. It can also be booked as a tour with most of the guest houses, e.g. Soe Brothers Guesthouse. 1,000 kyat. (updated Jan 2019 | edit)
13 Bayin Nyi Cave (22 km from the bridge on the way to Thaton). Placed in a beautiful surrounding with a nearby lake and pagoda. edit
