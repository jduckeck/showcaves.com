        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Il-Maqluba</b> is a huge collapse doline or sinkhole.
            The name means "reversed", "upturned", or "upside-down" in Maltese.
            Its formation happened in historic times and is thus documented: on 23-NOV-1343 it was formed during a violent winter storm, probably there also was an earthquake.
            The most obvious guess is that the collapse was either caused by an earthquake or even more likely was the source of a local earthquake.
            But legend is much more fantastic.
            It tells about a collapsed underground cavern excavated by the Phoenicians.
            Or it was formed by the wrath of God or Devil (choose one) which makes it either an evil or sacred place.
            Whatever the reason was: in the 14th century a chapel was built at the edge of the sinkhole which is consecrated to Saint Matthew.
            The first written mention of this chapel was by Inquisitor <b class="smallCaps">Dusina</b> in the report of his pastoral visit to the Maltese Diocese between 1574 and 1575.
        </p>

        <div class="foreign">
            This place was once inhabited by bad people who lived together in a hamlet named Il-Maqluba.
            God warned the village, through a good woman living close by, to change their sinful ways.
            As the bad people did not heed these warnings, God decreed that the land swallowed the hamlet, sparing only the good woman.
            Angels were dispatched to dispose the hamlet by dumping it into the sea.
            The angels threw the rock into the sea just off the southwest coast of Malta, thus creating the island of Filfla.
        </div>

        <p>
            A different version of this legend goes like this:
        </p>

        <div class="foreign">
            God tore the ground beneath the bad hamled and sent the inhabitants crashing through to hell.
            But they were so evil that not even hell could hold them, and in desperation the devil threw the depraved sinners with a huge junk of earth and trees, out of hell and back into the night sky.
            The tangled mass of rock, vegetation and godless souls landed in the sea and thus created Filfla.
        </div>

        <p>
            There are numerous variations to this legend.
            Sometimes the warner was a man, sometimes it was a nun.
            Also, the event was accompanied by a storm, a tempest, an earthquake or whatever.
            Or the chapel already existed and the collapse stopped right in front of it.
            Or the place of the chapel was the place where the good woman lived and was spared, and later the chapel was built at this place.
            The hamlet is called tal-Maqluba or Hal-Lew.
        </p>

        <p>
            And then there is the story of Phoenician wells or probably cisterns.
        </p>

        <div class="foreign">
            According to some studies the ancient Phoenicians excavated many large wells in this area.
            A half-bell shaped well is still intact and can be seen easily covered with deffun.
            The type of limestone in this area is called <b>Tas-Sekonda</b> which means a very soft and inferior type of limestone, which deteriorates very quickly.
            During many years the heavy rains weathered the stones where the wells were excavated and formed this depressed land.
        </div>

        <p>
            But it is not only the legends about the sinkhole’s origins which are varied.
            The facts about its size are similarly variable.
            Some say the sinkhole was covering an area of some 6000 m², other say 4,765 m².
            It’s unclear which one is true, the guess that the first number is rounded and thus less reliable may be misleading.
            The diameter is given around 50 m and the depth around 15 m.
            The satellite image of Google gives a size of 100 m from north to south and a width of 66 m east-west.
            This is about 5,000 m².
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Lest stick with the obvious first.
            This doline is a typical sinkhole, a cave below collapsed, creating an elliptical hole with vertical or overhanging walls.
            This hole has the debris of the collapsed ceiling on the floor, which is more or less level.
            The form is elliptical, with the main axis in north-south direction.
            On the western side is a sort of gorge which deepens towards the doline, probably cut by a river flowing into the doline.
            At the beginning of this valley lies St Matthew’s Chapel.
            To visit the sinkhole start at the chapel, when you see the facade there is a fence on the left side, with a trail leading down the deepening valley.
            At the end of this valley, which is at the edge of the doline is a viewpoint.
            And the valley is the reason for the next legend.
        </p>

        <p class="foreign">
            Il-Maqluba is the only sediment-free sinkhole that collects rainwater from a five-kilometre radius.
        </p>

        <p class="">
            This and similar statements are repeated on various websites, but in the speleological sense they are sheer nonsense.
            There is no such thing as sediment free, the floor consists of debris covered by sand, clay and soil, which is all sediment.
            Probably they want to tell us that it is the only doline which was not filled with sediment to the rim, and thus actually forms a pit.
            But again that is nonsense, such statements are easily refuted by example:
            <a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../mt/karst/Tuta.html"><img alt="Karst" class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Karst.png">Għar Tuta</a>.
            The whole island is karstified, and thus it is characterized by <i>underground draina</i>ge.
            The statement that the water would flow on the surface in the surrounding five kilometers is thus nonsense.
            There are obviously patches of impermeable rock, and water flows on the surface for some distance until it finally enters a crack, or in this case the doline.
            That's obviously how the small valley was formed.
            But there are no signs of other surface drainage in the area, and definitely of this enormous size.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The ground of the doline has its own microclimate, a result of the wind protection by the steep walls and the water in the surrounding area which flows unerground towards the doline.
            The floor of the doline is covered by dense <b>maquis</b> dominated by <b>Bay Laurel</b> (<i>Laurus nobilis</i>) and Malta’s National Tree, the <b>Sandarac Gum Tree</b> (<i>Tetraclinis articulata</i>).
            Malta’s National Bird, the <b>Blue Rock Thrush</b> (<i>Monticola solitarius</i>) is breeding at Il-Maqluba.
            The Maquis shrubland in the immediate surroundings of the doline has <b>Carob trees</b> (<i>Ceratonia siliqua</i>) and <b>Hawthorn</b> (<i>Crataegus monogyna</i>).
        </p>
