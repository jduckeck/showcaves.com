            GIANT’S KETTLE, Giant’s Cauldron or Pot-Hole, in physical geography, the name applied to cavities or holes which appear to have been drilled in the surrounding rocks by eddying currents of water bearing stones, gravel and other detrital matter.
            The size varies from a few inches to several feet in depth and diameter.
            The commonest occurrence is in regions where glaciers exist or have existed; a famous locality is the Gletscher Garten of Lucerne, where there are 32 giant’s kettles, the largest being 26 ft. wide and 30 ft. deep; they are also common in Germany, Norway and in the United States.
            It appears that water, produced by the thawing of the ice and snow, forms streams on the surface of the glacier, which, having gathered into their courses a certain amount of morainic débris, are finally cast down a crevasse as a swirling cascade or moulin.
            The sides of the crevasse are abraded, and a vertical shaft is formed in the ice.
            The erosion may be continued into the bed of the glacier, and, the ice having left the district, the giant’s kettle so formed is seen as an empty shaft, or as a pipe filled with gravel, sand or boulders.
            Such cavities and pipes afford valuable evidence as to the former extent of glaciers (see J. Geikie, The Great Ice Age).
            Similar holes are met with in river beds at the foot of cascades, and under some other circumstances.
            The term “pot-hole” is also sometimes used synonymously with “swallow-hole” (q.v.).

        <p class="">
            <b>Potholes</b> are common and widespread erosional forms.
            A river with high energy, i.e. a large gradient, transports sand, rubble and boulders.
            This material erodes the walls and bottom of the riverbed, forming rounded shapes.
            Whirlpools, however, cause the water to always transport its load in a circle at the same point, thereby drilling a large hole in the riverbed.
            This creates a pothole.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The resulting potholes are as varied as the whirls themselves.
            They are usually round or oval, but can also be spiral-shaped and usually have a vertical wall.
            They are typically much deeper than their diameter and resemble boreholes.
            The bottom is often flat, but three holes arranged in an isosceles triangle (offset by 60°) at the bottom are also typical.
            These in turn can form sub-whirlpools.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Depending on their formations this kind of holes is found everywhere where water flows.
            Gorges and river caves are a good place to look for them.
            Potholes are common in caves, as many caves or at least parts of cave systems were formed by flowing water.
            But they are not restricted to caves, and they are not even typical karst features.
            Potholes are found in all kinds of rocks and everywhere on earth.
            Many are found at the mouth or the former location of glaciers, where centuries of flowing melting water formed the most extraordinary <b>rockmills</b> or <b>glacier mills</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Often the bigger rocks which are turned and swirled around by the water and helped to drill the hole cannot leave the tub again and are now lying on the bottom.
            They were rounded by the movement and have a spherical form.
            They are sometimes called <b>millstone</b> or <b>drillstone</b>, or simply pebbles.

            This erosional form has numerous names, and we used a different one before, but we have updated the website for various reasons we must explain.
            The first thing we have to handle is the overwhelming number of synonyms.
            Potholes are also called <b>pot</b>, <b>kettle</b>, <b>stream kettle</b>, <b>giant's kettle</b>, <b>giants cauldron</b>, <b>swirlholes</b>, <b>dolly tub</b>, <b>evorsion</b>, <b>hollow</b>, <b>rock mill</b>, <b>churn hole</b>, <b>eddy mill</b>, and <b>kolk</b> or <b>colk</b>.
            It's unclear why there are so many different names, but in most cases these are regional names.
            They all have in common that they describe either the form of a cauldron or kettle, or the way they are formed by milling around.
            It seems a century ago the term <b>Giant's Kettle</b> was the most commonly used term in scientific literature, see the Encyclopædia Britannica entry above.
        </p>

        <p class="">
            Today the term <b>pothole</b> is the most common name for those holes, and so we finally decided to use this term on <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span>.
            This was a hard decision, as there are various drawbacks:
        </p>

        <ol class="italic">
            <li>British cavers will have some problems with this term, they use it for daylight shafts, vertical shafts which reach the surface, and sometime even for a cave.
                Its part of the name of caving clubs, and potholing is a synonym for caving.
                Many texts on <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span> were written by <b class="smallCaps">Tony Oldham</b>, who uses the term this way.
            </li>
            <li>Pothole is associated with holes in roads, this is the normal use of this term.</li>
            <li>The Wikipedia disambiguation page lists six completely different uses for this term, and five of them are related to geology.</li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>

        <p class="">
            For many years we used the term <b>dolly tub</b>, which was quite practical as this term was not used for anything else and thus the danger of a mixup was zero.
            This term is officially listed on the <b>UIS Caver's Multi-lingual Dictionary</b> as Concept ID 91.
            But unfortunately the dictionary and <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span> are the only websites which actually use this term.
