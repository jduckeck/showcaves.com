        <p>
            Tufa deposits are rather common in limestone karst areas, where limestone is
            dissolved by water and redeposited again.
            It is the subaerial form of the subterranean dropstones, but much more common.
            Tufa is deposited as soon as the karstification begins, even if there are no
            well developed caves.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The process of solution depends on the carbon dioxide amount in the water, and
            processes which influence the carbon dioxide amount also influence the limestone
            solution.
            The solution starts when carbon dioxide rich water reaches the limestone, the
            carbon dioxide originates from the atmosohere, enters the rain water while it
            falls to the ground.
            In covered karst the soil covering the limestone is full of life, and like all
            life based on oxygene the microorganisms feed on carbonates, oxydize them, and
            exhale carbon dioxide.
            So the amount of the gas is much higher than in the atmosphere.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The water becomes with the carbon dioxide a very weak acid, mineral water has
            the typical smell.
            In the limestone the acid solutes limestone until it is neutralized.
            Chemists say the water is saturated with limestone.
            But when the water reaches the surface, the environment changes, carbon dioxide
            leaves the water and so the water is <b>over-saturated</b>.
            This means, the water contains more limestone than it can hold, and the
            limestone is deposited as soon as possible.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There are various reasons why carbon dioxide is removed from the water.
            The most important and common is the exchange with the surrounding air.
            In the soil the amount of carbon dioxide is ten times higher than in the
            atmosphere.
            As a result the water contains ten times as much carbon dioxide.
            As soon as it reaches the surface, the carbon dioxide moves between water and
            atmosphere, the water surface works like a membrane.
            The water continually looses carbon dioxide until it has the normal amount which
            is equivalent to the amount in the atmosphere around.
            The process of loosing carbon dioxide is speedened by fast moving water, as any
            form of spraying increases the amount of surface and thus speedens the exchange.
            The increase of temperature adds to this process, as the amount of carbon
            dioxide which is soluted in water decreases with rising temeratures.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            And finally there is a biological component.
            As soon as the water reaches the surface, plants grow in the water.
            It starts with algae, then moss and finally higher plants like ferns and bushes.
            Especially the algae and moss, which grow in the flowing water, consume the
            carbon dioxide.
            They reduce it with photosynthesis and keep the carbon for their growth, the
            oxygen is released into the water.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            As a result, the loss of carbon dioxide immediately after the spring is immense.
            The oversaturated looses and deplosites an huge amount of limestone while it
            flows.
            Calcite crystals grow on the floor of the brook, on the plants, at the shores
            and in the flowing water.
            Most of the calcite covers the algae and moss, just to be overgrown by the next
            generation of moss.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The structure of the limestone is typical.
            Covering plants which subsequently are decomposited, the limestone has numerous
            holes of all sizes.
            It is rather soft and lightweight.
            When it is still wet, it is possible to cut it with saws or chains.
            But when it dries it becomes harder and lighter and is a very good rock for
            building houses.
            Because of its porosity is a very good isolator.
            It was often used to build barnstables, as the limestone neutralizes the
            emissions of the animals.
            Today tufa is not used any more, because the quarrying is a lot of work and thus
            expensive, and the deposits are small and most of them protected.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Other places of high limstone deposition are steps in the floor and along the
            shores.
            The growing limestone forms dams across the brook, across the valley, and along
            the river.
            Somtimes the whole slope is covered by tufa, sometimes channels and dams are
            built on which the water flows.
