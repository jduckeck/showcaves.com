            Karst springs are springs that are fed from karst areas.
            Cave springs, i.e. springs inside caves, are not called karst springs.
            Springs in karst areas differ from other springs because they are the end of a water-filled cave system:
        </p>

        <div class="invisibleBox">
            <ul>
                <li>They normally have a much higher yield or discharge.</li>
                <li>They are highly dependent on the weather, every heavy rain and, of course, the snow melt leads to increased yield.</li>
                <li>Karst springs regularly fall dry in dry periods, e.g. during the summer, such springs are called
                    <a target="_top" href="../../../english/explain/Karst/Seasonal.html"><img alt="Karst" class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Karst.png">Seasonal Spring</a>.
                </li>
                <li>Karst springs are not a good source for water supply.
                    The water is often quite shortly underground, and when it reappears it is not sufficiently cleaned by filter materials or bacteria.
                </li>
                <li>Each source is assigned a <b>catchment area</b>, which is determined by dye tracing tests with special dyes or salt.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="">
            The strong differences in the flow of a karst spring and the poor water quality are obviously related to the characteristics of the catchment area, i.e. the karst area.
            The water percolates on the surface through crevices, thus quickly entering cave systems and flowing downhill in crevices and caves (river caves) similar to a stream.
            This results in a very high velocity, especially compared to flowing through pore spaces.
            The water is only in the mountain for a few days, the microorganisms responsible for purifying the groundwater in sand or gravel have too little surface to attack and too little time to do their job.
            A heavy rain may reappear at the spring after a few hours or a few days, while at normal flow the water is underground for days or weeks.
            Normal springs on the other hand use the pores of porous rock and the water is often underground for years.
            If karst springs are used for drinking water, the whole catchment area must be strongly protected with mandatory sewage treatment plants for every settlement, restriction for industry, farming, trucks transporting liquids, and much more.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A famous accident happened about 100 years ago in the karst area
            <a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../fr/region/FrancheComte.html"><img alt="Region" class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Region.png">Jura</a>
            in France, at the border to Switzerland.
            There is the location of the still existing and famous <b>Pernod Company</b>, which produced the real <b>Absinth</b>, which was, however, banned in 1915 due to various slightly toxic ingredients.
            There was a fire at their factory in Pontarlier.
            Fearing an explosion of the tanks filled with high-proof alcohol, they were drained into the sewage system.
            A million litres of absinthe poured into the upper reaches of the Doubs.
            Only one day later the water of the <b>Loue Spring</b> got milky and the air smelled like anis and alcohol.
            This was the first (unintentional)dye tracing experiment in the history of karst research, but today special dyes or salt are used, which is much cheaper.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In geology, there are numerous attempts to classify springs according to the geological situation.
            An important classification is <b>karst spring versus non-karst springs</b>.
            Others are <b>deep versus shallow</b>, <b>changes in outflow</b>, or <b>magnitude of flow</b>:
        </p>


        <h3>Classification by Zone</h3>

        <p>
            Karst is soluble rock with water, the groundwater fills the cracks and caves in the rock to a certain level called <b>karst water level</b>.
            The water filled rock below is called <b>phreatic zone</b> or saturated zone, the air filled rock above is called <b>vadose zone</b> or unsaturated zone.
            However, the water level changes over time, depending on inflow and outflow, so there is actually a third zone which is called <b>epiphreatic zone</b> or floodwater zone.
            Like the phreatic zone it is water filled, but not all the time.
            In other words: karst springs may originate either from the continually waterfilled phreatic zone or from the regularly flooded epiphreatic zone.
        </p>

        <div class="invisibleBox">
            <ul>
                <li>The <b>river caves</b> or <b>epiphreatic caves</b>, where the cave ends with a portal from which the river flows out horizontally, and where one can normally enter the cave.
                    Often, however, the entrance area is blocked off and the water pushes out from crevices in the blockage.
                    The springs are called <b>Resurgence</b>.
                </li>
                <li>The <b>underwater caves</b> or <b>phreatic caves</b>, which are deeper and completely and permanently filled with water.
                    They always have a source pot, a blue basin connected to the water-filled cave system.
                    Sometimes you can dive into this cave system this way, but it can also be blocked off so that the bottom is made of blockage and the water comes out of many crevices.
                    The springs are called <b>Vauclusian Spring</b>, after the Vaucluse spring in France.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h3>Classification by Changes in Flow</h3>

        <p>
            The yield of karst springs depends very much on the inflow, and as the karst is not good at storing water the response is rather fast.
            The change of the outflow follows patters which depend more or less on the weather, and it is possible to classify the springs for their behaviour.
        </p>

        <div class="invisibleBox">
            <ul>
                <li><b>perennial springs</b> (permanent springs) flow constantly during the year.</li>
                <li><b>periodic springs</b> (seasonal springs) flow in certain seasons (typically snow melt or wet season) and fall dry in the dry season.</li>
                <li><b>intermittent springs</b> (temporary springs, rhythmic springs) are active after rainfall, or during certain seasonal changes.</li>
                <li><b>episodic springs</b> (Hungerbrunnen) flow and fall dry at rather short regular or irregular intervals.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h3>Classification by Magnitude of Flow</h3>

        <p>
            A spring with a particularly large discharge is also called a <b>giant spring</b>, <b>first magnitude spring</b>, or <b>mammoth spring</b> in common speech.
            This requires a large cave system and a large catchment area that supplies this large amount of water.
            Often it is the re-emergence of a whole river that previously disappeared in a swallow hole.
            This classification is not limited to karst springs, yet the springs with the strongest discharge are karst springs.
            Like always with such numeric criteria classification is simply done by defining thresholds.
