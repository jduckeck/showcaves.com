        We left the City of Rooks, as Nashville is called, on
        Thursday morning at half-past four, and travelled ninety
        miles to our place of destination for the night, which occupied
        19 hours. The stages in this part of the country lose
        a great deal of time needlessly by stopping for meals a great
        deal oftener than people require them. During our ride
        we had breakfast at 21 miles from Nashville, at a place
        called Tyree Springs, and that was acceptable enough; but
        before it was well digested we had to stop for dinner, and
        then again for supper, in three hours more; and as the
        people in this last hotel, which was at a pretty little town
        called Bowling Green, did not wish to be at the trouble of
        making one supper for their own boarders and another for
        the coach travellers, we were compelled to “bide their
        time” though not any of us wanted supper at all, and here
        we lost an hour and a half. In our journey we were interested
        in the day time by the great variety of wild flowers
        we saw, and after dark by the crowds of fire-flies in the
        air, in the trees, in the fields. We reached Bell’s,<a data-ajax="false" class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> where
        we were to stay for the night, at half-past 11, where we
        might have had another meal, but we did not like. Bell, a
        civil old fellow, is famed for making a kind of Atholl brose,
        of old peach brandy and honey, which we had a tasting of,
        and then went to bed; but Mr Bell’s brose I shall never
        taste again, for although it is pleasant enough to taste, yet
        I could not get the disagreeable flavour of the peach brandy
        out of my mouth the whole of the next day. After a capital
        breakfast, Bell sent us in a four horse stage to the Mammoth
        Cave, a distance of eight miles, over one of the roughest
        roads I ever encountered; but what we have seen in this
        wonderful place amply compensates for any trouble or difficulty
        we may have undergone. I am really quite at a loss
        how to begin to give you the least idea of the place, for it
        is almost beyond description; at all events I feel quite sure
        that any kind of description given in writing, by any mortal
        man, cannot afford to a stranger the smallest notion of the
        wondrousness, the sublimity, the awfulness of this cave—this
        stupendous work of Nature. First let me tell you,
        however, that it contains 226 avenues; at least that number
        has been discovered, for there are more than that;
        forty-seven domes, eight cataracts, pits innumerable, and
        eight rivers, only three of which have been explored. It
        was first discovered by the whites in 1802, and during the
        last war with England immense quantities of saltpetre were
        made in it, the remains of the utensils for the manufacture
        of which are still to be seen at a short distance from the
        entrance, and even the marks of the hoofs of the oxen the
        miners used can be traced in the ground. It is only about
        ten years since the curious began to visit the cave, and
        every year the visitors increase in number, and they must
        continue to do so as the wonders of the place become more
        talked of. About the end of June is the time for crowds
        coming, and there is ample accommodation for more than
        two hundred people in a very comfortable hotel, with an
        obliging and intelligent host, named Mosher. There is no
        other visitor here at present but ourselves. Having given
        you so much preliminary, I shall endeavour to give you an
        inkling of what we saw during our
    </p>

        The necessary alterations having been made in the costume
        of my two daughters, namely, the petticoats being shortened,
        and trousers being donned—pants, I ought to have said, for
        trousers are never named here, and breeches are never made—and
        caps being placed upon their craniums, a gentleman, who
        accompanied us from Nashville, and myself, having been provided
        with coats that had been coats once, and low-crowned
        soft hats, we set off for the cave. We were fortunate in getting
        the services of the favourite guide Stephen, to whom we
        had a letter from a lady in Nashville. He is an active, intelligent,
        attentive, capital fellow, and after walking some 200
        yards through an avenue of shady trees, we found him near
        the entrance, with his lamps ready to light, his flask of oil on
        his back, and one basket of provisions. We descended by
        about thirty rude steps to the entrance, where our lamps
        being lighted, we bade farewell for a while to the light of
        day. In a very short time we come to a wall that had been
        built by the miners, and in which there is a door-way, inside
        of which we are fairly in the cave. The temperature of the
        cave is always at sixty, and when the temperature out of
        doors is higher, the air rushes out at this doorway, so as to
        blow out the lamps, if the command of the guide is not
        obeyed to keep your lamps before you. At first one cannot
        see very well—the eyes are not yet accustomed to penetrate
        the darkness—the lamps only tended to make the darkness
        more visible. By and by we get more used to it. The
        “Church,” as it is called, is the first apartment where we make
        a halt. It is very large, with galleries round it, and a projection
        of rock at one side, called the pulpit. Being told by
        the guide to put our lights behind us, he set fire to a Bengal
        light, and then we were struck with wonder and awe at the
        splendour and the vastness of the rocky apartment. For
        size, Exeter Hall is nothing to it. During the season
        service is performed in it by some of the clergymen visitors,
        and the effect must be very sublime, to see each worshipper
        sitting with his lamp, listening to the Word, joining in
        prayer to the Lord of all, and singing his praises. Each
        person enters with his lamp, of course, but on coming to the
        church the lamps are all placed together, so as to make one
        general grand light. The church is in the “Main Cave,”
        which is five miles in extent, and as we move along we see the
        marks of the action of the water upon the rocks in every part.
        The average height is 50 feet, its width 100 feet; at one
        place, however, it is 340 feet wide. We leave the Main
        Cave, and enter the “Gothic Avenue,” where the first apartment
        we come to is called the “Haunted Chamber,”
        from two mummies having been found there by the miners
        in 1809. They were in a sitting position, and clothed with
        deer-skins. One of them is now in a museum in New York;
        the other was burned by the museum in Cincinnati taking
        fire. The friend who was with me being somewhat of a
        utility sort of a person, wishes everything to be made proper
        use of, and suggested that the cave would be a capital place
        for keeping meat, vegetables, &amp;c., when he was told by
        Stephen, much to his satisfaction, that the hotel people used
        it for that purpose. We go along farther, and soon find
        ourselves in the “Register Room,” which has, or rather had,
        a beautiful white ceiling, but it is now considerably defaced
        by many persons wishing to immortalise themselves by writing
        their names on the roof with the smoke of a candle.
        They must have had the candle attached to a pretty long
        pole, for the roof is high. I. B. of old England is one of
        the names; I suppose John Bull is meant. There is also a
        Mr John Smith—it does not state where his locale is, but it
        is not unlikely that it was Mr Smith of the United States.
        After passing “Vulcan’s Forge,” so called from the stone
        resembling very much the refuse of a forge, we come to the
        “Gothic Chapel.” Before entering it, however, Stephen
        takes our lamps, and leaves us in the dark for a time, while
        he goes and places them on the stalactite pillar in the chapel.
        He calls out to us to “come on—there’s nothing to stumble
        over,” and we advanced towards the chapel. How splendid!
        how beautiful! The stalactite pillars are all opposite to
        each other, as if they were really supporting the roof. It
        reminded me of the crypt under the Cathedral at Rochester,
        in Kent, excepting that here the pillars were translucent.
        About ten or twelve feet high are the pillars, and the stalactite
        formations are still going on in some of them. It has
        been ascertained, it seems, that it takes thirty years to form
        the thickness of a wafer, then how many times thirty years
        must it have taken to form these pillars! It was a solemn
        scene, the stillness was indeed quite awful. I broke the
        silence by singing Luther’s Hymn, while those around me
        stood like statues. We came next to what is called
        “Napoleon’s Breastwork,” an immense block of limestone,
        that has evidently fallen away from the roof at some time
        or other, and now lies in a slanting form. It is about 60
        feet long, 20 feet to the top, and looks over into a deep
        ravine. Now we come to his Satanic Majesty’s “Armchair,”
        which is the name given to a splendid stalactite column in the
        centre of a chamber, and which on one side forms an excellent
        seat. The back is round, and like one of the old fashioned
        chairs stuffed, and covered with silk. You may have an idea
        of the size of it when I tell you that it takes three men’s arms
        to go round it. Not far from it is another stalactite formation
        called the “Elephant’s Head,” from its exact resemblance
        to one—the eyes, ears, and trunk, are perfect—some
        barbarian, however, has defaced the trunk. Now we
        approach the “Lover’s Leap,” where any hapless swain
        may have an opportunity of getting rid of all his earthly
        cares by taking a dismal leap of 50 feet, but no one has yet
        been desperate enough to do it. We descend to the left of
        the “Lover’s Leap” and presently enter an extraordinary
        passage in the rock, called the “Devil’s Elbow;” it is about
        three feet wide and twelve high, and leads to the lower
        branch of the Gothic Avenue. The stone of the passage
        bears evidence of water having rushed through it with tremendous
        force, though how long ago it is impossible to
        ascertain. One of the guides got a terrible fright here
        some time since, by a gentleman who was gifted with ventriloquial
        powers. He had arrived at the hotel in the evening,
        and requested a guide to accompany him to the cave.
        While they were standing over the “Lover’s Leap” he
        made a cry for “lights and some water,” which seemed to
        come through the “Devil’s Elbow” from the apartment
        below. The guide, fancying it was some one of his companions
        whose lamp had gone out, called out to him to stay
        where he was and he would come to him immediately; as
        he was descending by the Devil’s Elbow the voice came
        from another part in front of them. He returned, and
        was ascending again to the Lover’s Leap, when the voice
        once more came through the Elbow, at which he became
        considerably alarmed, and it was with great difficulty the
        gentleman could prevent him from running fairly off out of
        the cave, and leaving him in the lurch, which perhaps he
        deserved. On their return to the hotel the guide told the
        landlord a woful story, in the midst of which, however,
        he was stopped by some one coming in to say there was a
        maniac about the grounds, when they went out and heard
        a voice calling out for some tea and bread and butter.
        “That’s it!” he said, “that’s the same voice that was in the
        cave.” The ventriloquist made the landlord aware of the
        trick, and the mysterious affair ended with a hearty laugh
        at the poor alarmed guide’s expense. As we enter this
        part of the Gothic Avenue, we come to a basin of beautiful
        clear water, called the “Cooling Tub.” It is about
        six feet wide, and a stream of the purest water is falling
        constantly into it from the ceiling, which is here about thirty
        feet high. In various parts of the cave there are streams
        of this description, and the sound of this falling water is the
        only thing that breaks the awful stillness that constantly
        reigns. After passing “Napoleon’s Dome,” which is about
        sixty feet in height, we come to another little pool, called
        “Lake Purity,” the water in which is delicious to drink, so
        pure that no disturbance can thicken it. Now we retrace
        our steps to the “Main Cave,” where at almost every step
        we take some new wonder is opened up to us. We are in
        an apartment called the “Ball Room,” for it is frequently
        used as such by the visitors during the season. The floor
        is smooth and level, and continues so for several hundred
        feet, so that there is plenty of room for a large party. There
        are spacious galleries above, too, formed by the ledging
        rocks; and there is an orchestra, capable of holding twice
        the number of the Philharmonic Band. As we go along gazing
        in wonder at everything, the eye suddenly rests on a nice
        little niche in the wall, just like the niche that is at the door
        of a Roman Catholic Cathedral for holding the holy water.
        It has been formed by the trickling down of the water, and
        is called Wandering Willie’s Spring; as I have considerable
        regard for all Wandering Willies, I partook of the water
        of his spring, and can vouch for its purity and refreshing
        qualities. The “Standing Rocks” that we by and by approach,
        are immense blocks of stone that have evidently
        fallen from the roof, some of them twenty feet long, and six
        or eight feet thick, and many of them even larger, and what
        is something remarkable, it is the thinnest part of the stone
        that has sunk into the earth. The next very prominent
        object we come to is the “Giant’s Coffin,” an immense block
        of limestone that has evidently fallen away from the side,
        and which perfectly resembles a coffin, but may well be
        called a giant’s, for it is sixty feet long and about twenty
        feet thick. It has the curved lid which I have observed in
        the fashionable coffins in the south, and which I heard an
        auctioneer, who was selling some by auction, recommend
        as being much more accommodating than the plain lids, for
        the person could turn round whenever he felt inclined to do
        so. At some distance beyond this, perhaps 150 yards, the
        cave takes a gigantic turn, called the “Acute Angle,” or
        “Great Bend,” which the guide illumines by one of his
        Bengal lights, and displays to the astonished spectator one
        of the most wonderful sights that ever mortal eyes beheld.
        It has the appearance of a vast amphitheatre. It must be
        about seventy feet high. In front of us is the great cornerstone
        or bend, and on each side the avenue looms away
        into unfathomable darkness. The Bengal light dies, and we
        trudge along to the right, with our lamps in our hands,
        single file, with Stephen at the head, and ere long he says,
        “Stop, we are now in the ‘Star-Chamber.’” Wonders will
        never cease, for here is something more wonderful than
        anything we have yet seen. How can I convey to you an
        idea of it? Let me see. It is as if we were at the bottom
        of a deep ravine or pass, about sixty feet wide, and one
        hundred feet high, the top of the ravine being terminated
        by jutting-out rocks, and above those projecting rocks we
        see the blue firmament of heaven, as it were, with the stars
        shining above us. The rocks at the top are white in many
        places, and cloud-like, which shows the starry firmament to
        greater advantage. The stars are formed by the sparkling
        gypsum in the dark limestone, and a more complete optical
        illusion dame Nature never called into existence. We felt
        as if we should never tire gazing on this, and expatiating
        to each other upon its wonders. Stephen asked us how we
        should like to have all the lights extinguished, to try the
        effect of it in that way, which we readily agreed to; but
        not a particle of anything could we see. There was, of
        course, not the smallest ray of light—there could not be,
        for we were two miles from the mouth of the cave, and
        170 feet below the surface of the earth. I put my finger
        close to my eye but could see nothing. When no one spoke
        the silence was awful. I don’t know what the others were
        thinking of in the midst of this total eclipse, but I could not
        help thinking, now, if Stephen should have forgot his matches
        we shall be in a fine <i>fix</i>. I spoke to him of this afterwards,
        when he said he should soon have got lights for us if he had
        forgot his matches, for he knows the cave so well, having been
        a guide in it for thirteen years, that he could have forced his
        way to the mouth. This Star-Chamber is one of the most
        pleasing sights in the cave. Not far from it are the remains
        of some small houses that were built some years ago for
        consumptive patients. The air is so pure and the temperature
        so equal, that they enjoyed very good health while
        they remained in the cave, but as soon as they went above
        ground they became as bad as ever; the idea, therefore, of
        making the cave an hospital for consumption has been
        abandoned. I forgot to say that while we were admiring
        the wonder of the Starry Chamber we sang a sacred trio,
        the effect of which was beautiful, for everything was so still—no
        interruption by whisperers, or those persons who are
        not aware that it is the height of rudeness to speak while any
        one is singing—the voices sounded large and full. The
        sublimity of the scene could not altogether withdraw the
        attention of our utility friend from the things of this earth, for
        while we were gazing in astonishment on the scene around
        us, he asked me whether, as I came from London, I had
        ever seen a work on the art of brewing by fermentation,
        and without yeast! The Star-Chamber was the extent of
        our walk in the Main Cave to-day. We returned as far as the
        Giant’s Coffin, behind which we entered an avenue, and
        descended some 12 or 14 steps, then through a very low
        and narrow passage into the “Deserted Chambers,” which
        we got to by crawling some part of the way on our hands
        and knees. The first of the Deserted Chambers is called
        the Wooden Bowl, from the fact of a wooden bowl having
        been found in it by the miners some years ago. At a short
        distance from this bowl we stopped to dine, sitting on the
        edge of a large flat rock, which we used as a dining-table.
        Close by there was a spring of clear delicious water. We
        enjoyed our repast amazingly; drank, in the pure, unadulterated
        water, to all our friends round St Paul’s; had some
        songs after dinner, then resumed our walk. Our attention
        was first directed to the “Sidesaddle Pit,” which is about 60
        feet deep; and to prevent one’s having a chance of falling
        into it, it is railed round by spars of sassafras tree, on one
        of which are two sprouts, which made their appearance
        about a month ago, and are looked upon with interest, for
        there is no other sign of vegetation within the place. The
        ceiling here, from water oozing through the stone, is just
        like honeycomb. A little further on we come to the
        “Bottomless Pit,” a frightful chasm with a fragile wooden
        bridge across it. A piece of lighted paper thrown from the
        bridge into the pit, shows us the depth of it, which, from the
        water to the top of the dome above us, is 280 feet. As we
        found that the splendid dome over head had no name, we
        called it St Paul’s, and insisted that Stephen should henceforth
        call it by that name, and no other.

        As we go along we see on the roof of the avenue the most
        beautiful stalactite formations—rosettes, &amp;c., in innumerable
        variety; there is indeed here a mixture of the sublime
        and beautiful. We come to the “Wild Hall,” well named
        from its appearance, go through the “Arch,” which is one
        of the most-beautifully formed natural arches that can be
        seen, return through what is called the Labyrinth, and go
        to “Gorin’s Dome.” Much as we had seen to astonish us,
        we were not prepared for the magnificence of the scene we
        were now to witness. Stephen placed us at an aperture
        about the ordinary size of a window, told us to lay down
        our lamps behind us, then he left us. By and by we discovered
        him on a point a considerable way above us, and he
        lighted one of his Bengals and unfolded the wonders of the
        dome to us. It is nearly 300 feet in height, and we were
        standing about half way up. The sides of the dome are
        fluted, and have the appearance of having been polished, for
        the water is still trickling down. It is utterly impossible to
        give any idea of the splendour of this place when lighted
        up. We had not seen half enough of it. We called for
        another Bengal light, but Stephen had not one more left,
        so we were obliged to leave, which we did, expressing our
        determination to visit the dome again in our next ramble.

    <p class="indentedText">
        We had now been five hours in the cave, and as we had
        more than two miles to walk to the mouth, we set off on our
        homeward route, and passed again some of our old acquaintances,
        the Giant’s Coffin, the Church, walked a little way
        down “Audribow’s Avenue,” and finally we saw the light
        of day glimmering before us, and as we drew nearer to the
        mouth I thought the sun never shone so beautifully before,
        and that the green grass and the foliage of the trees, in fact
        the whole face of nature, was more lovely than ever. When
        fairly out of the cave we felt as if hot air was being blown
        upon us, so oppressively warm did the atmosphere feel. And
        so finished our first day in the Mammoth Cave. We returned
        to the hotel, spent the evening in thinking over
        and talking of the wonders we had seen, then went to bed
        pretty early, to prepare ourselves for being up betimes to
        start upon our second day’s ramble.
    </p>

    <h2 class="center" id="c2">SECOND DAY’S RAMBLE.</h2>

    <p>
        To-day there were three grand points of the cave which
        we hoped to visit, namely, the Chief City or Temple, the
        Mammoth Dome, and the Fairy Grotto. We entered about
        seven o’clock, after a capital breakfast at the hotel, and
        passed over a good deal of the ground we visited yesterday.
        We left Audribow’s Avenue on our left, came to the Church
        again, which we could not help taking another look at, went
        on through the Main Cave, passing the Giant’s Coffin,
        coming to the Great Bend, then entering again the Star
        Chamber, through which we passed, and came to the Salts
        Room; here there are layers of salts in the sides of the
        chamber, and from the roof they hang in crystals. They
        taste very pure, and not at all unpleasant, and are used
        medicinally by the people in the neighbourhood of the cave,
        when they can coax any of the guides to bring them a supply.
        By kindling a fire in this apartment, or putting all the
        lamps together so as to create a tolerable heat, the salt
        comes down in flakes like a fall of fleecy snow. As we
        trudge along the Main Cave (so called because all the other
        avenues branch off from it), the mind cannot but be filled
        with awe while contemplating the wonders of this immense
        tunnel. It is as if we were walking through the bed of a
        river, and the ceiling, generally about sixty feet high, looks
        something like a cloudy sky; indeed, one part of it is called
        the Floating Clouds. Soon, however, our ceiling becomes
        very low, and our road very rough; we are compelled to
        crawl a considerable way on our hands and knees, and are
        not at all displeased when we reach the Banquet Hall, for
        here there is plenty of room to stand up, the ceiling being
        40 feet high, and the width of the apartment about 700 feet.
        We were very glad to sit down too, and Stephen went to a
        distance and lighted one of his Bengal lights, which showed
        us the glories of this immense apartment. While we were
        resting here Stephen sang some negro songs very well—a
        merry fellow is Stephen, and has a good voice. One of his
        ditties pleased us very much—it was about uncle Ned, an
        old nigger, who died long ago, and who had no wool on de
        top ob his head, de place where de wool ought to grow. I
        sang my poor friend Rooke’s song of “My Boyhood’s
        Home,” from Amilie, and then we resumed our journey,
        passing by two cataracts, each of which falls about 50 feet.
        Our road was very difficult, indeed, and exceedingly toilsome,
        notwithstanding the fact that one can undergo a great
        deal more fatigue in the cave than it is possible to do in the
        open air; but when we reached the point at which we were
        aiming, our toils were amply repaid by the magnificence of
        the Chief City, or Temple. This dome is 120 feet high, the
        roof being of smooth solid rock; it is 300 feet across, and
        960 feet in length. In the middle of it is a large heap of
        stones called the Mountain, up which we clambered to see
        this immense area of darkness illuminated. It is impossible
        to conceive anything more sublime than this rocky hall
        when lighted up by the Bengal; and it is as impossible for
        words to convey to one who has never seen it the least idea
        of its magnificence. But the light went out too soon. “Another
        Bengal! another Bengal! Stephen!” was the cry
        that immediately burst from every one. “Ah!” said Stephen,
        “I knew that would be the case.” He then formed a light
        not quite so brilliant as the Bengal, but which lasted longer,
        and in whose softness there was more awe in contemplating
        this vast place. We remained here a long time, sometimes
        in dismal silence, and sometimes breathing forth a sacred
        song, or one of a serious character, for one of any other description
        would have been quite out of place. Moore’s “Oft
        in the stilly night” I sang very softly, but it sounded immensely
        in the silence; and, if I may judge of the effect of
        it upon Stephen, it was very solemn, for he said it made him
        cry. He sang us no more nigger songs till we were fairly
        out of the Temple. We turned our steps now towards the
        Fairy Grotto, the way to which is also very difficult—a great
        deal of crawling again under low ceilings, but which is
        generally got over very good-humouredly, each one’s mishaps
        causing a hearty laugh to the others. When you reach
        the apartment you discover that it is not inaptly named the
        Fairy Grotto, and are soon rapt in admiration of the beautiful
        stalactites before you. The lamps are placed in the
        pillars and other parts of the grotto, in the same way as at
        the Gothic Chapel, and the effect is very fine. The stalactites
        were once whiter than they are now, for the smoke of
        the lamps has darkened them not a little. While admiring
        the endless variety of stalactite beauties before us, one cannot
        help feeling sorry that visitors should be so barbarous
        as to break them off, for they but rarely can get a rosette
        or anything else whole; they therefore spoil the beauty of
        the grotto, without being able to carry away a satisfactory
        trophy of their destructive deeds. The stalactite formations
        are still going on in the grotto, for the water
        is constantly oozing through, and many a crystal drop may
        be seen hanging from the end of the bunch of beauties
        already formed. There are some thick massy pillars, some
        stalactites and stalagmites not yet met—the stalagmite is
        the formation on the ground caused by the dropping of the
        water from the stalactite, which hangs as it were from the
        roof; many of them are beautifully and fantastically shaped,
        and the effect of the light shining through them is rich
        in the extreme. After feasting our eyes on this splendid
        scene, we left the Solitary Cave, and entered again the Main
        Cave, and when we got as far as the Giant’s Coffin, we once
        more dived down behind it into the Deserted Chambers, and
        passing through the Wooden Bowl, we regained our dining-hall
        of yesterday, and finding ourselves quite ready for a repast,
        we again dined here, and drank of the clear delicious
        spring, and after a long rest and chat, and some music, we
        set out on our further travels. We soon came to the Bottomless
        Pit, and our new-named St Paul’s Dome, and passing
        on entered the Valley of Humility, so called from the visitor
        being obliged to stoop very much while walking through it,
        for it is only about four feet high; a short avenue takes us
        to the Winding Way, otherwise called the Fat Man’s Misery,
        a most extraordinary freak of nature. It is 109 yards long,
        and about 15 inches broad, and of solid rock. It widens
        about three feet from the ground, so that one has play for
        his arms; but it keeps constantly winding, there being not
        more than two or three feet straight at a stretch, and must
        perplex very much any tolerably stout person who finds
        himself winding through it. Although it is called the Fat
        Man’s Misery, yet it has sometimes proved the fat woman’s
        misery too, for a very stout lady, if there is such a thing in
        the world, got into it once, and stuck fairly. The appendix,
        to her quite unnecessary, of a bustle, was squeezed out of
        existence; and in winding her way, she nearly winded herself;
        she breathed fast, but stuck faster; she, being so great,
        became greatly alarmed, and her friends were compelled to
        haul her through till they got into Great Relief, which the
        avenue at the end of the Winding Way is very appropriately
        called, and which she frankly confessed was the greatest
        relief to her that she had ever in her life experienced. In
        the avenue of Great Relief we saw the point to which the
        river rose in January last, which is fifty-six feet above its
        usual level. In going along we come to two routes, one of
        which leads to the river, where we intend going to-morrow,
        and another to the Mammoth Dome, whither we now steer
        our course. We come first, however, to the Bacon Chamber,
        another curious freak of dame Nature; the ceiling is
        low, and has the appearance of being hung with canvass covered
        bacon hams and shoulders, so curiously has the action
        of the water formed these stones. There is another curious
        formation in this chamber. In a part of the ceiling there is
        the appearance of a stratum having dropped out for about
        20 feet, about one foot broad, and the same in height, and
        the vacuum is in the form of a serpent. Our next place to
        gaze at is the Bandit’s Hall, a wonderfully wild looking
        apartment of great magnitude, the floor being covered with
        rocks of various sizes, that have evidently fallen from the
        ceiling. It was like being among some wild rocky mountains,
        with the sky far above us, and when lighted up was
        a magnificent spectacle of wild rugged scenery. Now for
        the Mammoth Dome. We sincerely hope it may be something
        worth looking at when we get to it, for our way is
        the most difficult, tedious, and toilsome that we have yet
        encountered; by this time, however, we were getting quite
        expert at creeping, and going sometimes in crab fashion,
        sidewise on our hands and feet. At last we emerge out of
        a hole, and find ourselves standing on the brink of a precipice,
        and hear the falling of water from a great height,
        and by the dim glimmer of our lights we see that there is
        something before us awfully grand and stupendous, and this
        is the Mammoth Dome! But we do not see it yet as we shall
        see it; we must descend 20 feet by a crazy-looking ladder,
        on which human foot has not been since last summer, in
        order that we may see the dome in all its glory. Well, we
        are down, and not a very easy task it is to get down; and
        we are standing there enjoying a kind of shower bath, while
        Stephen goes upon a height to light up—and when he does
        light up we forget the water that is showering down upon
        us—we forget everything but the grand scene before us.
        We look on the vast space lighted up, and we see the sides
        of this immense dome, or tower it might be called, for it is
        nearly four hundred feet high, fluted, polished, here pillars,
        there capitals of the most elaborate description, as if the
        cunningest hand of the cunningest craftsman had been
        there—ay, and has he not been there? It is something
        like Gorin’s Dome, which we saw yesterday, but much
        larger. It may well be called the greatest wonder of this
        wondrous place. Stephen must give us another Bengal.
        Again we gaze in astonishment at this unparalleled wonder,
        and see beauties we did not see before. The light fades and
        dies, and again deep impenetrable gloom holds its sway. We
        ascend the ladder to our old ledge of rock at the mouth of
        the hole by which we must return, and feel thankful when
        we find ourselves safely at the top of it, take one last look
        at the dome, and then retrace our steps. When this dome
        was discovered in 1842, a lamp was found at the bottom of
        it, which puzzled the finders not a little as to how it could
        have got there. Inquiry was made of an old man who lives
        near the cave, and who worked in it when a boy at the saltpetre
        factories, and he remembers of a man being let down
        by a rope to look for saltpetre, and that he dropped his
        lamp. What a situation to be in! Dangling at the end of
        a rope in the dark, with perhaps a vacuum of 300 feet below
        him! We now set off for the mouth of the cave, and had to
        go over the same rough ground we traversed before. Having
        been nine hours under ground to-day, and some of our
        party being heartily tired, we were very glad to see the
        light of heaven again.

    <h2 class="center" id="c3">THIRD DAY’S RAMBLE.</h2>

    <p>
        Although we had a day’s rest yesterday, it being Sunday,
        my eldest daughter was not sufficiently recovered from the
        fatigues of Saturday to encounter another day’s journeying
        in the cave, which might perhaps be more fatiguing than
        any we had yet undergone, and so my youngest and myself
        sallied forth, both of us being very anxious to see the ferlies
        across the river. It has been doubtful for some days whether
        we should be able to cross the river, for, like all the rivers for
        a considerable time past, it has been so high that there has
        not been sufficient room for a boat to pass between the river
        and the rocky ceiling above. However, Green River, which
        flows at about half a mile’s distance from the mouth of the
        cave, has fallen considerably since last night, which affords
        some hope that the river in the cave may also have fallen,
        and Stephen assures us that he will get us to the other side
        some way or other, if we should go through Purgatory,
        which he suspects we shall have to do. We take an additional
        guide with us, named Alfred, in case his services
        may be required. We trudge along the Main (and at a
        pretty smart pace), till we reach the Giant’s Coffin, behind
        which we again descend, and go through the Deserted
        Chambers, pass the Bottomless Pit and again get into the
        Winding Way, through which having winded, we leave the
        Bacon Chamber on the right, and take the passage to the
        left, which leads to the Dead Sea, which may be seen by looking
        over a precipice, and sending a blazing piece of paper
        to the regions below. At eighty feet distance it reaches the
        still water of the Dead Sea. We journey on through avenues
        till we reach the River Styx, which we cross in a boat,
        then we walk a little farther till we get to Lethe. We sail
        along it in our frail bark till the water becomes so shallow
        that we can go no farther. Echo River is the great one we
        have to cross, and as the guides are uncertain about the state
        of it, they leave us till they ascertain by what means we are
        to get to the other side. It was no very delightful situation
        for solitary helpless individuals to be left alone in a boat in the
        middle of a river so far under the face of the earth, and with no
        sound of anything near us save the trickling of invisible waterfalls,
        and nothing with any sign of life but gnats that fluttered
        about our lamps, and now and then a large cricket
        with immense long legs, but there was no “hearth” for it to
        be on, nor did it chirp. In this river are the eyeless fish;
        there are two kinds of them, neither having the least resemblance
        of a place for an eye, for, of course, they have no
        need of eyes. The solitariness of such a scene can scarcely
        be conceived. However, we must not think of it; we sang
        and chatted. The echo was magnificent, and sounding
        chords afforded us some amusement. The four notes of the
        chord, sounded by one voice, continued to sound altogether
        for a very long time, and at length died away by almost inaudible
        sounds. After being in this lonely situation for an
        hour, we were cheered by hearing the voices of the guides,
        singing at a long distance from us. As they came nearer we
        discovered that it was “Auld lang syne” they were singing,
        and I am sure I never heard that favourite air with greater
        pleasure or satisfaction. At length the glimmer of the lamps
        is seen in the distant darkness, and the guides approach us,
        awakening the echoes with “Oh, Susanna,” “Old Uncle
        Ned,” and other negro ditties. We learn that we cannot
        embark at the usual place, but must go round by Purgatory
        Avenue. They have to carry us through the shallow water
        about fifty yards, till we come to walking ground, then we
        reach a ferry which we cross in a boat, and Alfred takes the
        boat through the archway at the usual place for embarking,
        to meet us at the end of the avenue; for we hear the water
        splashing against the ceiling, and we cannot go that way. He
        must lie down flat in the boat, and get through as he best can.
        We reach the point of the river where he had come to, and
        there is no sign of him. We wait patiently for a time, and at
        length the awful silence is broken by the sounds of his voice,
        singing to let us know he has got through in safety. The effect
        of the solitary lamp on the water is astounding. We now
        all embark, and sing our way down the Echo River for about
        a quarter of a mile, when we get out, and walk again for
        some distance, then cross the river again, on Stephen’s back,
        and at last we are fairly on the other side. The river was discovered
        in 1839, and first crossed in 1841. As we go along,
        although we are fifty or sixty feet above the river, marks
        of its recent rise are visible, for the sand is very wet, and
        our road very slippery. The avenue in which we now are
        must have been filled with water to the very ceiling, and
        our path is an awfully wild one, strewed with immense rocks
        that have fallen from above, and the ceiling is like a dark
        midnight sky. The walls are beautifully ornamented with
        rosettes, &amp;c., of stalactite in great profusion. We are now
        in Lillyman’s Avenue, and have come to a bend, something
        like the Great Bend on the other side of the river. This
        bend resembles exactly the stern of a large ship, and we see
        it as if we were in the water looking up at it. It is called
        the Great Western. The avenue, which is two miles long,
        is terminated by an apartment called Ole Bull’s Concert
        Room, for here the great violinist discoursed eloquent music
        to a large party whom he accompanied into the cave some
        years ago. We now enter the Pass of El Ghor, which is
        two miles long, very narrow, that is, it averages a breadth
        of six or eight feet, and a height of about fifteen or
        eighteen. There is a singular-looking place in it called
        The Hanging Rocks, which are immense blocks of stone
        rent from the roof, and hanging as it were in air, ready
        to annihilate any half-hundred people that may venture
        under them, but fortunately they don’t. We leave the
        Pass, and enter Spring-side, when we ascend a ladder
        about fifteen feet into a place called Mary’s Vineyard,
        one of the most extraordinary freaks in the whole
        cave. It looks as if all the dark coloured grapes had
        been collected from half the vineyards on the Rhine
        and deposited here. The clusters are perfect, and the
        formations are still going on. It was lighted up with a
        Bengal, and the effect of it is indescribable. We pass on
        to Washington Hall, or the Spar Chamber, as it is sometimes
        called, a large and beautiful apartment, where the
        walls and roof are covered with beautiful ornaments, and
        by and by we reach the Snow-ball Room, which has the
        appearance of there having been a formidable battery of
        snow-balls directed against the roof, many of which are
        beautifully formed, like large white roses. We proceed to
        Cleveland’s Cabinet, which is about two miles in length, and
        filled with stalactite beauties, various parts of it being distinguished
        by particular names, such as Mary’s Bower, a beautiful
        part—St Cecilia’s Grotto, Charlotte’s Grotto, Mary
        Reedie’s Festoon, &amp;c., the walls of the whole for several miles
        being covered with rosettes, Prince of Wales’ feathers, tulips,
        lilies, &amp;c., and often we see a piece like a richly carved Corinthian
        capital. We must not forget the Diamond Grotto, where,
        by holding your lamp behind you, a never-ending profusion
        of sparkling diamonds is seen among the stalactite beauties.
        Many beautiful specimens have fallen on the ground, and
        many have been knocked from the place where Nature deposited
        them by the ruthless hand of some visitor. We
        brought away some specimens with us, but they are very
        brittle and very heavy, which makes it difficult to procure
        many. It is said there are rats in this part of the cave,
        though it is difficult to imagine what they can support
        themselves and their families upon, for they cannot exist
        on the beautiful ornaments by which they are surrounded
        any more than the California miner can live on the gold
        he finds; but sometimes they get a chance for food. It is not
        long since two young men came from New York with the
        determination of exploring the cave. They took provisions
        with them to last for three days, and had Stephen for their
        guide. They had their blankets with them, and after one
        day’s exploration, they fixed on Cleveland’s Cabinet for
        their sleeping chamber. When they got up in the morning,
        and went for their basket to breakfast before setting out
        on their travels, they found every particle of food gone, and
        they had a trudge of eight miles to the mouth of the cave
        for a breakfast. The rats are different from the usual
        species, they leap something like a rabbit, and are very
        seldom seen. Beyond Cleveland’s Avenue, we came to the
        Rocky Mountains, an exceedingly difficult place to travel
        over, then get to the Dismal Hall, a gloomy-looking place,
        about 100 feet high—Sereno’s Arbour, well worthy to be
        visited, and Medora’s Spring, are at the farthest extent of
        the explored part of the cave, and here we are nine miles
        from the mouth. We now returned, and saw on our way
        the Snow-ball Chamber lighted up with a Bengal, which, if
        possible, increased its beauty. We stopped to dine at a
        little spring not far from the foot of the ladder by which
        we descended from Mary’s Vineyard, and, after resting for
        a time, we entered once more the Pass of El Ghor, and
        continued our way looking with regret for the last time
        upon the many wonders we had already explored. As we
        approached the river we found the walking as bad as ever,
        but we got over safe. As Alfred was carrying me along
        the Styx on his back, he stepped upon a quicksand, and sank
        considerably, which I not liking, and being quite ignorant
        as to where he was likely to sink to, I jumped from his back,
        in spite of Stephen’s shouts to “hold on to him! hold on to
        him!” It afforded me a hearty laugh, for the water scarcely
        came to my knees, and the exertion of clambering over
        rocks, and walking along on the rough road, soon made
        all dry. Once on this side the river, we trudged on
        nimbly through the Fat Man’s Misery and the Valley of
        Humility, and getting into the Main Cave from behind the
        Giant’s Coffin again, we were not long in seeing the light of
        day. I nearly forgot to mention, that as we were sailing up
        the Echo River on our way home, Alfred, the guide, caught
        two of the eyeless fish. They are small, about a finger’s
        length, one of them like a minnow, and the other something
        like a shrimp. There is not the slightest appearance of eyes
        about them. We heard also the sound of a voice at some distance,
        which Stephen knew to be that of one of the guides,
        and when we got up on the walk about fifty feet above the
        river, we saw at a great distance three individuals standing
        beside the river, their lamps beside them. The effect was
        awfully sepulchral—they looked like beings of the nether
        regions. By the by, the place through which we traversed
        to the spot where we saw them, is called the Infernal Regions.
        The visitors soon joined us, and we left the cave together.
        They had only gone to the bank of the river. It
        will be long ere we forget our visit to the Mammoth Cave.
        The season not commencing till about the end of June,
        we had it all to ourselves, and enjoyed it much; but even
        when there is a crowd of people there, it must add to the
        amusement to meet parties as one rambles through the cave,
        though one would scarcely get into such a place for amusement.
        It fills the mind with thoughts something deeper than amusement.
        No accident of a serious nature has ever happened
        in the cave, for the guides are very careful, and every precaution
        is taken to prevent accidents. Very soon after the river
        was discovered two young gentlemen, accompanied by two
        young ladies, went to cross it. They were full of spirits and
        too full of fun, for despite the guide’s warning that the boat
        was very crazy, they, in getting into it, upset it. Their lamps
        were all extinguished, and their matches lost. Fortunately
        the guide got them out of the water, and placed them on
        some rocks, where they were obliged to remain for several
        hours, till the people in the hotel sent to see what detained
        them so long in the cave. They were in a terrible fright,
        and no wonder. Another gentleman who had left his party,
        in his ardour to examine some particular point, lost his way
        in attempting to rejoin them, and wandered about shouting
        till his lamp went out, when he sat down, and he was thirty
        hours alone before they found him. There is no danger if
        the parties keep together and with the guide, but to attempt
        to find the way oneself were a useless task.<a data-ajax="false" class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a>
        We left the
        Mammoth Cave Hotel at six in the evening, and had a
        pleasant ride to Bell’s, at eight miles distance. The road is
        through the woods and very rough, but will be smoother by
        and by, when there is more traffic on it. Mr Bell has improved
        it very much this spring, at his own expense, for he
        has the conveying of all the visitors from the house to the
        cave, and very reasonably he does it. As I before mentioned,
        he is an obliging and attentive old man, Mr Bell, and
        if you get into his good graces, he will not be sparing of his
        peach brandy and honey, though he very wisely takes none
        of it himself; and perhaps he may take you into the garden,
        where he will show you something that will strike you as
        being very singular, if you are an Englishman. In a corner
        of the garden, under a quiet tree, you will see a neat tombstone,
        which will tell you that there the old man’s son lies,
        and two of that son’s children, and perhaps he may tell you
        himself that he is conducting the house and farm for the benefit
        of that son’s widow and surviving child, whom he wishes to
        see comfortably provided for before he be laid in the quiet
        corner beside his son. After spending five hours at Bell’s
        we got the stage for Louisville, ninety miles distant, over a
        road that is not of the best, and to make it worse there is a
        storm brewing, the lightning is flashing, the thunder is roaring,
        the rain is coming down in torrents, and the fire flies
        are whirling in the air in myriads.

        I saw part of a panorama of the Upper Mississippi,
        which a French artist named Pomerade has been engaged on for
        some years, and which he has nearly finished. It is beautifully
        painted, and must prove very interesting, for he has introduced
        Indian scenes, customs, &amp;c., and has also machinery which sets
        the steam-boats agoing, &amp;c. He intends to have four views from
        the Mammoth Cave as drop-scenes; if he succeeds in giving anything
        like a faithful representation of them, it will add much to the <i>eclat</i>
        of his picture.
