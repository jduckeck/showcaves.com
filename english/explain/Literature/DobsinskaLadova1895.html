            Balch was an American who was educated in France and Germany and after graduating from
            Harvard, was admitted to the Philadelphia Bar. He never practised his
            profession, instead he lived the life of a wealthy gentleman and
            travelled widely.

            D&oacute;bsina Jegbarland, in the Carpathian Mountains, is easily reached
            either from Popr&aacute;d to the north, or from D&oacute;bsina to the south. The hotel
            at Popr&aacute;d is better, however, than the inn at D&oacute;bsina, where my brother
            and I spent two nights. It was decidedly primitive. The food was not so
            bad, but the pigs ran round in the courtyard, and one morning a gypsy
            band woke us at half-past three o'clock by playing in front of our
            windows, in dreadful wailing tones, which were most irritating at that
            hour. At the proper time, however, Hungarian gypsy music, - despite the
            fact that none of the players ever seem to look at the leader, and that
            each man appears to play the tune he likes best, - is stangely
            fascinating.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            D&oacute;bsina itself lies in a hollow, surrounded with well-wooded hills, the
            general appearance much resembling some of the valleys of the White
            Mountains of New Hampshire. My brother and I started from D&oacute;bsina on the
            morning of the 27th of July, 1895, at half-past seven o'clock, in a
            little open carriage excellent horses and a Hungarian driver in national
            costume. He was a nice fellow, but he did not understand a word of
            German. The road reminded us of some of our own mountain roads, as it
            was rough, full of holes and partly washed away by the rains. We first
            ascended to the crest of the surrounding hills and then descended to the
            Stracena Thal, a wild limestone valley covered with fine forest. Two and
            a half hours driving landed us at the hotel-restaurant near the cave, at
            which I should certainly stop on another visit. It was half an hour's
            stroll thence, through beautiful woods to the cavern entrance.
            North-wards in the distance the T&aacute;tra Range was visible, a set of sharp
            bare rock peaks, at whose base, ensconced in pine forests, is situated
            the famous Hungarian summer resort or T&aacute;tra Füred.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The entrance to the cavern is enclosed by a fence with a gate, and here
            the D&oacute;bsina people have a high tariff and take toll from tourists. At
            the gate, we waited for half an hour, until a sufficient number of
            persons had arrived to form a party. This mode of visiting the cave
            rather detracts from the pleasure, even though it does away with all
            difficulty and makes the beauties of D&oacute;bsina accessible to everyone. It
            is necessary to wait long enough to cool off thoroughly before entering,
            on account of the icy air of the cavern, where heavy winter clothes are
            indispensable.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The entrance to D&oacute;bsina faces nearly due north. It is small, perhaps two
            meters wide and three meters high, and is perfectly sheltered from any
            wind. The sudden drop in temperature at the entrance was startling; in
            fact it was the most extreme temperature change I have noticed in any
            cave. Within the length of an ordinary room, say in a distance of five
            meters, we passed from an extremely hot summer morning to the chill of a
            mid-winter afternoon. A slight air current, perhaps, issued from the
            entrance, as we observed a faint mist here. At the rock portal there was
            ice on the rocks overhead, and underfoot was the beginning of the huge
            mass of ice which almost fills the cavern. A descent down eighteen
            wooden steps landed us at the beginning of the huge ice floor, which is
            called the <i>Großer Saal</i>. It is a magnificent cave. The floor is a sheet
            or rather a mass of solid ice, the surface of which is level enough in
            one place to permit skating; in other spots it is sloping and covered
            with small ice hillocks. The ice is solid throughout, without any holes
            or cracks. Several fissure columns stream to the floor from cracks.
            Joining the roof to the floor are numerous big ice stalactites, which
            form frozen pillars and columns. These are from eight to eleven meters
            in height, and some two to three meters in average breadth and width.
            Nearly translucent, they are covered with all sorts of icy ornaments
            hanging about them in tufts and fringes; they are beautiful in their
            shapes, as well as in their white and blue colours. One of these columns
            is called the <i>Brunnen</i>, because until ten years ago, a small stream
            dribbled continuously from the roof and cut a channel across the ice
            floor; but now the stream has solidified into the pillar, and the channel
            is filled up, although it can still be traced in the ice.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cavern is lighted by electricity, which has the merit, even if it
            brings in an element of artificiality, of clearly revealing one of the
            chief glories of D&oacute;bsina. This is the rime or hoar frost, which in the
            shape of ice or snow crystals, covers the entire limestone roof, and,
            reflecting the electric light, shines like frost silver. Some of these
            crystals seem to be precipitated to the floor, and in one place I found a
            small sheet of them, perhaps two meters in width each way, which looked
            and felt like genuine snow. The general color effect of all this upper
            cave is white, although there is some blue in the ice, and gray and brown
            in the rock and shadows. It would not be much of a misnomer to call
            D&oacute;bsina "the great white cave".
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The ice extended to the sides of the cave except in two places. Here
            there were holes in the ice, bridged by rock arches. We passed through
            one of these and descended by a wooden staircase some eighty steps,
            afterwards returning up through the other arch by another staircase. At
            the bottom we stood in a magnificent gallery named the <i>Korridor</i>, formed
            by a solid wall of ice on one side and by a wall of limestone rock on the
            other.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The ice wall is the lower portion of the ice floor; the rock wall is the
            continuation of the roof. For the entire distance the ice wall rises
            almost perpendicularly some fifteen meters in height, while the rock wall
            arches overhead.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The bottom of the <i>Korridor</i> was filled with blocks of fallen limestone,
            through which any water drains off, and on which there was a wooden walk,
            so that we circled round the ice with the greatest ease. At one place on
            the limestone wall hung a cluster of big icicles, which, from their shape
            really deserved the name they bear, of the <i>Orgel</i>. At another place a
            hole, some six or seven meters deep, was hewn, in the form of a small
            chamber, directly into the ice mass. This is the <i>Kapelle</i>, where we
            performed our devotions by leaving our visiting cards on the floor. Near
            the middle of the <i>Korridor</i> the ice mass bulges out and extends to the
            limestone wall, breaking the whole <i>Korridor</i> into two parts, the western
            portion about eighty meters, and the eastern about one hundred and twenty
            meters long. This necessitated cutting a tunnel about eight meters long
            in the ice to get through. The color of the <i>Korridor</i> is a darkish gray
            and is much more sombre than that of the ice <i>Großer Saal</i>. A remarkable
            feature of the ice wall is the fact that distinct bands of stratification
            are visible in the ice in many places. Why the <i>Korridor</i> is not filled up
            with ice and why the ice is perpendicular for such a distance are
            questions I am unable to answer satisfactorily; but it is probable that
            the temperature of the rock walls is sufficiently high to prevent the ice
            from forming in winter or to melt it in summer if does not in winter.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The air in D&oacute;bsina seemed still, and scarcely felt damp. In one or two
            places in the <i>Großer Saal</i> there was a slight sloppiness, showing
            incipient signs of thaw. In the <i>Korridor</i> it was freezing hard.
