            Dóbsina Jegbarland, in the Carpathian Mountains, is easily reachedeither from Poprád to the north, or from Dóbsina to the south. The hotelat Poprád is better, however, than the inn at Dóbsina, where my brotherand I spent two nights. It was decidedly primitive. The food was not sobad, but the pigs ran round in the courtyard, and one morning a gypsyband woke us at half-past three o'clock by playing in front of ourwindows, in dreadful wailing tones, which were most irritating at thathour. At the proper time, however, Hungarian gypsy music, - despite thefact that none of the players ever seem to look at the leader, and thateach man appears to play the tune he likes best, - is stangelyfascinating.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Dóbsina itself lies in a hollow, surrounded with well-wooded hills, thegeneral appearance much resembling some of the valleys of the WhiteMountains of New Hampshire. My brother and I started from Dóbsina on themorning of the 27th of July, 1895, at half-past seven o'clock, in alittle open carriage excellent horses and a Hungarian driver in nationalcostume. He was a nice fellow, but he did not understand a word ofGerman. The road reminded us of some of our own mountain roads, as itwas rough, full of holes and partly washed away by the rains. We firstascended to the crest of the surrounding hills and then descended to theStracena Thal, a wild limestone valley covered with fine forest. Two anda half hours driving landed us at the hotel-restaurant near the cave, atwhich I should certainly stop on another visit. It was half an hour'sstroll thence, through beautiful woods to the cavern entrance.
            North-wards in the distance the Tátra Range was visible, a set of sharpbare rock peaks, at whose base, ensconced in pine forests, is situatedthe famous Hungarian summer resort or Tátra Füred.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The entrance to the cavern is enclosed by a fence with a gate, and herethe Dóbsina people have a high tariff and take toll from tourists. Atthe gate, we waited for half an hour, until a sufficient number ofpersons had arrived to form a party. This mode of visiting the caverather detracts from the pleasure, even though it does away with alldifficulty and makes the beauties of Dóbsina accessible to everyone. Itis necessary to wait long enough to cool off thoroughly before entering,on account of the icy air of the cavern, where heavy winter clothes areindispensable.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The entrance to Dóbsina faces nearly due north. It is small, perhaps twometers wide and three meters high, and is perfectly sheltered from anywind. The sudden drop in temperature at the entrance was startling; infact it was the most extreme temperature change I have noticed in anycave. Within the length of an ordinary room, say in a distance of fivemeters, we passed from an extremely hot summer morning to the chill of amid-winter afternoon. A slight air current, perhaps, issued from theentrance, as we observed a faint mist here. At the rock portal there wasice on the rocks overhead, and underfoot was the beginning of the hugemass of ice which almost fills the cavern. A descent down eighteenwooden steps landed us at the beginning of the huge ice floor, which iscalled the <i>Großer Saal</i>. It is a magnificent cave. The floor is a sheetor rather a mass of solid ice, the surface of which is level enough inone place to permit skating; in other spots it is sloping and coveredwith small ice hillocks. The ice is solid throughout, without any holesor cracks. Several fissure columns stream to the floor from cracks.
            Joining the roof to the floor are numerous big ice stalactites, whichform frozen pillars and columns. These are from eight to eleven metersin height, and some two to three meters in average breadth and width.
            Nearly translucent, they are covered with all sorts of icy ornamentshanging about them in tufts and fringes; they are beautiful in theirshapes, as well as in their white and blue colours. One of these columnsis called the <i>Brunnen</i>, because until ten years ago, a small streamdribbled continuously from the roof and cut a channel across the icefloor; but now the stream has solidified into the pillar, and the channelis filled up, although it can still be traced in the ice.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cavern is lighted by electricity, which has the merit, even if itbrings in an element of artificiality, of clearly revealing one of thechief glories of Dóbsina. This is the rime or hoar frost, which in theshape of ice or snow crystals, covers the entire limestone roof, and,reflecting the electric light, shines like frost silver. Some of thesecrystals seem to be precipitated to the floor, and in one place I found asmall sheet of them, perhaps two meters in width each way, which lookedand felt like genuine snow. The general color effect of all this uppercave is white, although there is some blue in the ice, and gray and brownin the rock and shadows. It would not be much of a misnomer to callDóbsina "the great white cave".
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The ice extended to the sides of the cave except in two places. Herethere were holes in the ice, bridged by rock arches. We passed throughone of these and descended by a wooden staircase some eighty steps,afterwards returning up through the other arch by another staircase. Atthe bottom we stood in a magnificent gallery named the <i>Korridor</i>, formedby a solid wall of ice on one side and by a wall of limestone rock on theother.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The ice wall is the lower portion of the ice floor; the rock wall is thecontinuation of the roof. For the entire distance the ice wall risesalmost perpendicularly some fifteen meters in height, while the rock wallarches overhead.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The bottom of the <i>Korridor</i> was filled with blocks of fallen limestone,through which any water drains off, and on which there was a wooden walk,so that we circled round the ice with the greatest ease. At one place onthe limestone wall hung a cluster of big icicles, which, from their shapereally deserved the name they bear, of the <i>Orgel</i>. At another place ahole, some six or seven meters deep, was hewn, in the form of a smallchamber, directly into the ice mass. This is the <i>Kapelle</i>, where weperformed our devotions by leaving our visiting cards on the floor. Nearthe middle of the <i>Korridor</i> the ice mass bulges out and extends to thelimestone wall, breaking the whole <i>Korridor</i> into two parts, the westernportion about eighty meters, and the eastern about one hundred and twentymeters long. This necessitated cutting a tunnel about eight meters longin the ice to get through. The color of the <i>Korridor</i> is a darkish grayand is much more sombre than that of the ice <i>Großer Saal</i>. A remarkablefeature of the ice wall is the fact that distinct bands of stratificationare visible in the ice in many places. Why the <i>Korridor</i> is not filled upwith ice and why the ice is perpendicular for such a distance arequestions I am unable to answer satisfactorily; but it is probable thatthe temperature of the rock walls is sufficiently high to prevent the icefrom forming in winter or to melt it in summer if does not in winter.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The air in Dóbsina seemed still, and scarcely felt damp. In one or twoplaces in the <i>Großer Saal</i> there was a slight sloppiness, showingincipient signs of thaw. In the <i>Korridor</i> it was freezing hard.
