<h1 align="center">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</h1>
<h2 align="center">by Mark Twain (Samuel L. Clemens)</h2>

<br clear="all">

<p>
This is an excerpt of the book of the chapters 30 to 33 where the story of a
loss in a cave is told.
The described cave is Mark Twain Cave, or at least this cave was the inspiration
to the novell.
It was later named after Mark Twain because of this text.

<h3>Chapter 30</h3>

<p>
AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came groping
up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman's door. The inmates were
asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the
exciting episode of the night. A call came from a window:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Who's there!"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Huck's scared voice answered in a low tone:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"It's a name that can open this door night or day, lad! - and welcome!"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
These were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears, and the pleasantest he had
ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied
in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he entered. Huck was
given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed
themselves.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast will be ready
as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot one, too - make yourself
easy about that! I and the boys hoped you'd turn up and stop here last
night."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"I was awful scared,"</i> said Huck, <i>"and I run. I took out when the
pistols went off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now becuz I wanted
to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn't want to
run across them devils, even if they was dead."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it - but
there's a bed here for you when you've had your breakfast. No, they ain't dead,
lad - we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right where to put our hands
on them, by your description; so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within
fifteen feet of them - dark as a cellar that sumach path was - and just then I
found I was going to sneeze. It was the meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it
back, but no use - 'twas bound to come, and it did come! I was in the lead with
my pistol raised, and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get
out of the path, I sung out, 'Fire boys!' and blazed away at the place where the
rustling was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and
we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them. They fired
a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by and didn't do us any
harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down
and stirred up the constables. They got a posse together, and went off to guard
the river bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to
beat up the woods. My boys will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort
of description of those rascals - 'twould help a good deal. But you couldn't see
what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Oh yes; I saw them down-town and follered them."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Splendid! Describe them - describe them, my boy!"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"One's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here once or twice,
and t'other's a mean-looking, ragged --"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"That's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back of
the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and tell the
sheriff - get your breakfast to-morrow morning!"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The Welshman's sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck sprang
up and exclaimed:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Oh, please don't tell ANYbody it was me that blowed on them! Oh,
please!"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what you
did."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Oh no, no! Please don't tell!"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"They won't tell - and I won't. But why don't you want it known?"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too much about
one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against
him for the whole world - he would be killed for knowing it, sure.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking
suspicious?"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Well, you see, I'm a kind of a hard lot, - least everybody says so, and I
don't see nothing agin it - and sometimes I can't sleep much, on account of
thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing. That was
the way of it last night. I couldn't sleep, and so I come along up-street 'bout
midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I got to that old shackly brick store
by the Temperance Tavern, I backed up agin the wall to have another think. Well,
just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something
under their arm, and I reckoned they'd stole it. One was a-smoking, and t'other
one wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their
faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard, by his white
whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t'other one was a rusty, ragged-looking
devil."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Well, I don't know - but somehow it seems as if I did."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Then they went on, and you --"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Follered 'em - yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up - they sneaked
along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile, and stood in the dark and heard
the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he'd spile her looks
just as I told you and your two --"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"What! The DEAF AND DUMB man said all that!"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep the old
man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be, and yet his
tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do. He
made several efforts to creep out of his scrape, but the old man's eye was upon
him and he made blunder after blunder. Presently the Welshman said:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"My boy, don't be afraid of me. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your head for all
the world. No - I'd protect you - I'd protect you. This Spaniard is not deaf and
dumb; you've let that slip without intending it; you can't cover that up now.
You know something about that Spaniard that you want to keep dark. Now trust me
- tell me what it is, and trust me - I won't betray you."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Huck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent over and
whispered in his ear:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"'Tain't a Spaniard - it's Injun Joe!"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and slitting
noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white men don't
take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a different matter
altogether."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man said that
the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going to bed, was to get a
lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood. They found
none, but captured a bulky bundle of --
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Of WHAT?"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more stunning
suddenness from Huck's blanched lips. His eyes were staring wide, now, and his
breath suspended - waiting for the answer. The Welshman started - stared in
return - three seconds - five seconds - ten - then replied:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Of burglar's tools. Why, what's the MATTER with you?"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The Welshman
eyed him gravely, curiously - and presently said:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Yes, burglar's tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what did
give you that turn? What were YOU expecting we'd found?"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Huck was in a close place - the inquiring eye was upon him - he would have given
anything for material for a plausible answer - nothing suggested itself - the
inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper - a senseless reply offered - there
was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered it - feebly:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Sunday-school books, maybe."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and
joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and ended by
saying that such a laugh was money in a-man's pocket, because it cut down the
doctor's bill like everything. Then he added:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Poor old chap, you're white and jaded - you ain't well a bit - no wonder
you're a little flighty and off your balance. But you'll come out of it. Rest
and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a
suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from
the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the talk at the widow's
stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure, however - he had not known
that it wasn't - and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his
self-possession. But on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened,
for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not THE bundle, and so
his mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to
be drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still in No.
2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and Tom could seize the
gold that night without any trouble or any fear of interruption.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck jumped for a
hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even remotely with the late
event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen, among them the Widow
Douglas, and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill - to
stare at the stile. So the news had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story
of the night to the visitors. The widow's gratitude for her preservation was
outspoken.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Don't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're more beholden
to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don't allow me to tell his
name. We wouldn't have been there but for him."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main
matter - but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors, and
through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he refused to part with his
secret. When all else had been learned, the widow said:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise.
Why didn't you come and wake me?"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to come again -
they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was the use of waking you up
and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard at your house all the
rest of the night. They've just come back."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of
hours more.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody was early
at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came that not a sign of
the two villains had been yet discovered. When the sermon was finished, Judge
Thatcher's wife dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down the aisle
with the crowd and said:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired to
death."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Your Becky?"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Yes,"</i> with a startled look - <i>"didn't she stay with you last
night?"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Why, no."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly, talking
briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Good-morning, Mrs. Thatcher. Good-morning, Mrs. Harper. I've got a boy
that's turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last night - one
of you. And now he's afraid to come to church. I've got to settle with him."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"He didn't stay with us,"</i> said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A
marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"No'm."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"When did you see him last?"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had stopped
moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding uneasiness took
possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously questioned, and young
teachers. They all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board
the ferryboat on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if
any one was missing. One young man finally blurted out his fear that they were
still in the cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and
wringing her hands.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to street, and
within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the whole town was up!
The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant insignificance, the burglars were
forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs were manned, the ferryboat ordered out,
and before the horror was half an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down
highroad and river toward the cave.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women visited
Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They cried with them,
too, and that was still better than words. All the tedious night the town waited
for news; but when the morning dawned at last, all the word that came was,
<i>"Send more candles - and send food."</i> Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and
Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from
the cave, but they conveyed no real cheer.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with candle-grease,
smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck still in the bed that had
been provided for him, and delirious with fever. The physicians were all at the
cave, so the Widow Douglas came and took charge of the patient. She said she
would do her best by him, because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he
was the Lord's, and nothing that was the Lord's was a thing to be neglected. The
Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"You can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave it off. He
never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village,
but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the news that could
be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had
never been visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to be
thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages,
lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance, and
shoutings and pistolshots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the
sombre aisles. In one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists,
the names <i>"BECKY &amp; TOM"</i> had been found traced upon the rocky wall
with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher
recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she
should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be
so precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the
awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck of
light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of
men go trooping down the echoing aisle - and then a sickening disappointment
always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher's light.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and the
village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything. The
accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the Temperance Tavern
kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the public pulse, tremendous as
the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns,
and finally asked - dimly dreading the worst - if anything had been discovered
at the Temperance Tavern since he had been ill.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Yes,"</i> said the widow.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Huck started up in bed, wild-eyed:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"What? What was it?"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Liquor! - and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child - what a turn you
did give me!"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Only tell me just one thing - only just one - please! Was it Tom Sawyer that
found it?"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The widow burst into tears. <i>"Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told you before,
you must NOT talk. You are very, very sick!"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great powwow if
it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever - gone forever! But what
could she be crying about? Curious that she should cry.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and under the weariness
they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"There - he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody could
find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left, now, that's got hope enough, or
strength enough, either, to go on searching."</i>
</p>

<h3>Chapter 31</h3>

<p>
NOW to return to Tom and Becky's share in the picnic. They tripped along the
murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar wonders of the
cave - wonders dubbed with rather overdescriptive names, such as <i>"The Drawing
-Room,"</i> <i>"The Cathedral,"</i> <i>"Aladdin's Palace,"</i> and so on.
Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it
with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome; then they
wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the
tangled web-work of names, dates, post-office addresses, and mottoes with which
the rocky walls had been frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and
talking, they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose
walls were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf
and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream of water,
trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it, had, in the
slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and
imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate
it for Becky's gratification. He found that it curtained a sort of steep natural
stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be
a discoverer seized him. Becky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark
for future guidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that,
far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and branched off
in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In one place they found a
spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites
of the length and circumference of a man's leg; they walked all about it,
wondering and admiring, and presently left it by one of the numerous passages
that opened into it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose
basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst
of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been
formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the result
of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had
packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the
creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and darting
furiously at the candles. Tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of
conduct. He seized Becky's hand and hurried her into the first corridor that
offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck Becky's light out with its wing
while she was passing out of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good
distance; but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at
last got rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly,
which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows. He
wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be best to sit down
and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the deep stillness of the place
laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children. Becky said:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Why, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the
others."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them - and I don't know how far
away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn't hear them
here."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Becky grew apprehensive.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"I wonder how long we've been down here, Tom? We better start back."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Yes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to me."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"I reckon I could find it - but then the bats. If they put our candles out it
will be an awful fix. Let's try some other way, so as not to go through
there."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!"</i> and the girl
shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long way,
glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar about the
look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an examination, Becky
would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he would say cheerily:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it right
away!"</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began to turn
off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of finding the one
that was wanted. He still said it was <i>"all right,"</i> but there was such a
leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as
if he had said, <i>"All is lost!"</i> Becky clung to his side in an anguish of
fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they would come. At last she
said:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem to get worse
and worse off all the time."</i>
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Listen!"</i> said he.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in
the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out
in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,"</i> said Becky.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<i>"It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,"</i> and he
shouted again.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The <i>"might"</i> was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so
confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but there was
no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried his steps. It was
but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another
fearful fact to Becky - he could not find his way back!
