            This is an excerpt of the book of the chapters 30 to 33 where the story of a loss in a cave is told.
            The described cave is Mark Twain Cave, or at least this cave was the inspiration to the novell.
            It was later named after Mark Twain because of this text.

        <h3>Chapter 30</h3>

        <p>
            AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came groping
            up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman's door. The inmates were
            asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the
            exciting episode of the night. A call came from a window:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Who's there!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Huck's scared voice answered in a low tone:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"It's a name that can open this door night or day, lad! - and welcome!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            These were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears, and the pleasantest he had
            ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied
            in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he entered. Huck was
            given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed
            themselves.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast will be ready
                as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping hot one, too - make yourself
                easy about that! I and the boys hoped you'd turn up and stop here last
                night."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"I was awful scared,"</i> said Huck, <i>"and I run. I took out when the
            pistols went off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come now becuz I wanted
            to know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn't want to
            run across them devils, even if they was dead."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it - but
                there's a bed here for you when you've had your breakfast. No, they ain't dead,
                lad - we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right where to put our hands
                on them, by your description; so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within
                fifteen feet of them - dark as a cellar that sumach path was - and just then I
                found I was going to sneeze. It was the meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it
                back, but no use - 'twas bound to come, and it did come! I was in the lead with
                my pistol raised, and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get
                out of the path, I sung out, 'Fire boys!' and blazed away at the place where the
                rustling was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and
                we after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them. They fired
                a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by and didn't do us any
                harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing, and went down
                and stirred up the constables. They got a posse together, and went off to guard
                the river bank, and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to
                beat up the woods. My boys will be with them presently. I wish we had some sort
                of description of those rascals - 'twould help a good deal. But you couldn't see
                what they were like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Oh yes; I saw them down-town and follered them."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Splendid! Describe them - describe them, my boy!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"One's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here once or twice,
                and t'other's a mean-looking, ragged --"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"That's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back of
                the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and tell the
                sheriff - get your breakfast to-morrow morning!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Welshman's sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck sprang
            up and exclaimed:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Oh, please don't tell ANYbody it was me that blowed on them! Oh,
                please!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what you
                did."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Oh no, no! Please don't tell!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"They won't tell - and I won't. But why don't you want it known?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too much about
            one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against
            him for the whole world - he would be killed for knowing it, sure.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking
                suspicious?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Well, you see, I'm a kind of a hard lot, - least everybody says so, and I
                don't see nothing agin it - and sometimes I can't sleep much, on account of
                thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing. That was
                the way of it last night. I couldn't sleep, and so I come along up-street 'bout
                midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I got to that old shackly brick store
                by the Temperance Tavern, I backed up agin the wall to have another think. Well,
                just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me, with something
                under their arm, and I reckoned they'd stole it. One was a-smoking, and t'other
                one wanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their
                faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard, by his white
                whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t'other one was a rusty, ragged-looking
                devil."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Well, I don't know - but somehow it seems as if I did."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Then they went on, and you --"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Follered 'em - yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up - they sneaked
                along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's stile, and stood in the dark and heard
                the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he'd spile her looks
                just as I told you and your two --"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"What! The DEAF AND DUMB man said all that!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep the old
            man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be, and yet his
            tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do. He
            made several efforts to creep out of his scrape, but the old man's eye was upon
            him and he made blunder after blunder. Presently the Welshman said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"My boy, don't be afraid of me. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your head for all
                the world. No - I'd protect you - I'd protect you. This Spaniard is not deaf and
                dumb; you've let that slip without intending it; you can't cover that up now.
                You know something about that Spaniard that you want to keep dark. Now trust me
                - tell me what it is, and trust me - I won't betray you."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Huck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent over and
            whispered in his ear:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"'Tain't a Spaniard - it's Injun Joe!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and slitting
                noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because white men don't
                take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That's a different matter
                altogether."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man said that
            the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going to bed, was to get a
            lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood. They found
            none, but captured a bulky bundle of --
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Of WHAT?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more stunning
            suddenness from Huck's blanched lips. His eyes were staring wide, now, and his
            breath suspended - waiting for the answer. The Welshman started - stared in
            return - three seconds - five seconds - ten - then replied:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Of burglar's tools. Why, what's the MATTER with you?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The Welshman
            eyed him gravely, curiously - and presently said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Yes, burglar's tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what did
                give you that turn? What were YOU expecting we'd found?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Huck was in a close place - the inquiring eye was upon him - he would have given
            anything for material for a plausible answer - nothing suggested itself - the
            inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper - a senseless reply offered - there
            was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered it - feebly:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Sunday-school books, maybe."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and
            joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and ended by
            saying that such a laugh was money in a-man's pocket, because it cut down the
            doctor's bill like everything. Then he added:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Poor old chap, you're white and jaded - you ain't well a bit - no wonder
                you're a little flighty and off your balance. But you'll come out of it. Rest
                and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a
            suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from
            the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the talk at the widow's
            stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure, however - he had not known
            that it wasn't - and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his
            self-possession. But on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened,
            for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not THE bundle, and so
            his mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to
            be drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still in No.
            2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and Tom could seize the
            gold that night without any trouble or any fear of interruption.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck jumped for a
            hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even remotely with the late
            event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen, among them the Widow
            Douglas, and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill - to
            stare at the stile. So the news had spread. The Welshman had to tell the story
            of the night to the visitors. The widow's gratitude for her preservation was
            outspoken.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Don't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're more beholden
                to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don't allow me to tell his
                name. We wouldn't have been there but for him."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main
            matter - but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors, and
            through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he refused to part with his
            secret. When all else had been learned, the widow said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise.
                Why didn't you come and wake me?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely to come again -
                they hadn't any tools left to work with, and what was the use of waking you up
                and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard at your house all the
                rest of the night. They've just come back."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of
            hours more.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody was early
            at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came that not a sign of
            the two villains had been yet discovered. When the sermon was finished, Judge
            Thatcher's wife dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down the aisle
            with the crowd and said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired to
                death."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Your Becky?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Yes,"</i> with a startled look - <i>"didn't she stay with you last
            night?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Why, no."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly, talking
            briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Good-morning, Mrs. Thatcher. Good-morning, Mrs. Harper. I've got a boy
                that's turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last night - one
                of you. And now he's afraid to come to church. I've got to settle with him."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"He didn't stay with us,"</i> said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A
            marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?"</i>

            Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had stopped
            moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding uneasiness took
            possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously questioned, and young
            teachers. They all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board
            the ferryboat on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if
            any one was missing. One young man finally blurted out his fear that they were
            still in the cave! Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and
            wringing her hands.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to street, and
            within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the whole town was up!
            The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant insignificance, the burglars were
            forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs were manned, the ferryboat ordered out,
            and before the horror was half an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down
            highroad and river toward the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women visited
            Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They cried with them,
            too, and that was still better than words. All the tedious night the town waited
            for news; but when the morning dawned at last, all the word that came was,
            <i>"Send more candles - and send food."</i> Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and
            Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from
            the cave, but they conveyed no real cheer.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with candle-grease,
            smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck still in the bed that had
            been provided for him, and delirious with fever. The physicians were all at the
            cave, so the Widow Douglas came and took charge of the patient. She said she
            would do her best by him, because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he
            was the Lord's, and nothing that was the Lord's was a thing to be neglected. The
            Welshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"You can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave it off. He
                never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village,
            but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the news that could
            be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had
            never been visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to be
            thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages,
            lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance, and
            shoutings and pistolshots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the
            sombre aisles. In one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists,
            the names <i>"BECKY &amp; TOM"</i> had been found traced upon the rocky wall
            with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher
            recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she
            should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be
            so precious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the
            awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck of
            light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of
            men go trooping down the echoing aisle - and then a sickening disappointment
            always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher's light.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and the
            village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything. The
            accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the Temperance Tavern
            kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the public pulse, tremendous as
            the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns,
            and finally asked - dimly dreading the worst - if anything had been discovered
            at the Temperance Tavern since he had been ill.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Yes,"</i> said the widow.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Huck started up in bed, wild-eyed:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"What? What was it?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Liquor! - and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child - what a turn you
                did give me!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Only tell me just one thing - only just one - please! Was it Tom Sawyer that
                found it?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The widow burst into tears. <i>"Hush, hush, child, hush! I've told you before,
            you must NOT talk. You are very, very sick!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great powwow if
            it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever - gone forever! But what
            could she be crying about? Curious that she should cry.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and under the weariness
            they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"There - he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody could
                find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left, now, that's got hope enough, or
                strength enough, either, to go on searching."</i>
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 31</h3>

        <p>
            NOW to return to Tom and Becky's share in the picnic. They tripped along the
            murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar wonders of the
            cave - wonders dubbed with rather overdescriptive names, such as <i>"The Drawing
            -Room,"</i> <i>"The Cathedral,"</i> <i>"Aladdin's Palace,"</i> and so on.
            Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it
            with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome; then they
            wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the
            tangled web-work of names, dates, post-office addresses, and mottoes with which
            the rocky walls had been frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and
            talking, they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose
            walls were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf
            and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream of water,
            trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it, had, in the
            slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and
            imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate
            it for Becky's gratification. He found that it curtained a sort of steep natural
            stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be
            a discoverer seized him. Becky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark
            for future guidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that,
            far down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and branched off
            in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In one place they found a
            spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites
            of the length and circumference of a man's leg; they walked all about it,
            wondering and admiring, and presently left it by one of the numerous passages
            that opened into it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose
            basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst
            of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been
            formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together, the result
            of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had
            packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights disturbed the
            creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds, squeaking and darting
            furiously at the candles. Tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of
            conduct. He seized Becky's hand and hurried her into the first corridor that
            offered; and none too soon, for a bat struck Becky's light out with its wing
            while she was passing out of the cavern. The bats chased the children a good
            distance; but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at
            last got rid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly,
            which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows. He
            wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be best to sit down
            and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the deep stillness of the place
            laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children. Becky said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Why, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the
                others."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them - and I don't know how far
                away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn't hear them
                here."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Becky grew apprehensive.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"I wonder how long we've been down here, Tom? We better start back."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Yes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to me."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"I reckon I could find it - but then the bats. If they put our candles out it
                will be an awful fix. Let's try some other way, so as not to go through
                there."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!"</i> and the girl
            shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long way,
            glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar about the
            look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an examination, Becky
            would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he would say cheerily:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it right
                away!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began to turn
            off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of finding the one
            that was wanted. He still said it was <i>"all right,"</i> but there was such a
            leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as
            if he had said, <i>"All is lost!"</i> Becky clung to his side in an anguish of
            fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they would come. At last she
            said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem to get worse
                and worse off all the time."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Listen!"</i> said he.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in
            the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out
            in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,"</i> said Becky.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,"</i> and he
            shouted again.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <i>"might"</i> was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so
            confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but there was
            no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried his steps. It was
            but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another
            fearful fact to Becky - he could not find his way back!
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to come
                back! No - I can't find the way. It's all mixed up."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Tom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! We never can get out of this awful place!
                Oh, why DID we ever leave the others!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom was
            appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He sat down by
            her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in his bosom, she clung to
            him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes
            turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom begged her to pluck up hope again, and
            she said she could not. He fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her
            into this miserable situation; this had a better effect. She said she would try
            to hope again, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he
            would not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she, she
            said.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            So they moved on again - aimlessly - simply at random - all they could do was to
            move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of reviving - not with
            any reason to back it, but only because it is its nature to revive when the
            spring has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with failure.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            By-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This economy meant so much!
            Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again. She knew that
            Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets - yet he must
            economize.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay
            attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to
            be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction, was at least
            progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten
            its pursuit.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down. Tom
            rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there, and the
            comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom tried to think
            of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements were grown threadbare
            with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she
            drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into her drawn face and
            saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and
            by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat
            of peace and healing into his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to
            bygone times and dreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke
            up with a breezy little laugh - but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a
            groan followed it.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Oh, how COULD I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I don't,
                Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and we'll find the
                way out."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"We can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I
                reckon we are going there."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on trying."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried to
            estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was that it
            seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not be, for their
            candles were not gone yet. A long time after this - they could not tell how long
            - Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water - they must find a
            spring. They found one presently, and Tom said it was time to rest again. Both
            were cruelly tired, yet Becky said she thought she could go a little farther.
            She was surprised to hear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat
            down, and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay.
            Thought was soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the
            silence:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Tom, I am so hungry!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Tom took something out of his pocket.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Do you remember this?"</i> said he.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Becky almost smiled.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"It's our wedding-cake, Tom."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Yes - I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all we've got."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grown-up people
                do with weddingcake - but it'll be our --"</i>
        </p>

            She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky ate with
            good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was abundance of cold
            water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky suggested that they move on
            again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Becky's face paled, but she thought she could.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to drink. That
                little piece is our last candle!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort her,
            but with little effect. At length Becky said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Tom!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Well, Becky?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"They'll miss us and hunt for us!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Yes, they will! Certainly they will!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Maybe they're hunting for us now, Tom."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"When would they miss us, Tom?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"When they get back to the boat, I reckon."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Tom, it might be dark then - would they notice we hadn't come?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"I don't know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they got
                home."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to his senses and he saw that he
            had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night! The children
            became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of grief from Becky showed
            Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers also - that the Sabbath morning
            might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher discovered that Becky was not at Mrs.
            Harper's.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it melt
            slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last; saw
            the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of smoke, linger at its
            top a moment, and then - the horror of utter darkness reigned!
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that she was
            crying in Tom's arms, neither could tell. All that they knew was, that after
            what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep
            and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said it might be Sunday, now - maybe
            Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but her sorrows were too oppressive, all
            her hopes were gone. Tom said that they must have been missed long ago, and no
            doubt the search was going on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He
            tried it; but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he
            tried it no more.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A portion
            of Tom's half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But they seemed
            hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted desire.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            By-and-by Tom said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"SH! Did you hear that?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the faintest,
            far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by the hand, started
            groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently he listened again; again
            the sound was heard, and apparently a little nearer.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"It's them!"</i> said Tom; <i>"they're coming! Come along, Becky - we're all
            right now!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow, however,
            because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded against. They
            shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three feet deep, it might be a
            hundred - there was no passing it at any rate. Tom got down on his breast and
            reached as far down as he could. No bottom. They must stay there and wait until
            the searchers came. They listened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing
            more distant! a moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The
            heart-sinking misery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no
            use. He talked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no
            sounds came again.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged on;
            they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed it must be
            Tuesday by this time.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It would be
            better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy time in
            idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to a projection, and he
            and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the line as he groped along. At
            the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a <i>"jumpingoff place."</i> Tom
            got down on his knees and felt below, and then as far around the corner as he
            could reach with his hands conveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a
            little farther to the right, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human
            hand, holding a candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious
            shout, and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to - Injun
            Joe's! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the next
            moment, to see the <i>"Spaniard"</i> take to his heels and get himself out of
            sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come over and
            killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have disguised the
            voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom's fright weakened every
            muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he had strength enough to get
            back to the spring he would stay there, and nothing should tempt him to run the
            risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He was careful to keep from Becky what it was
            he had seen. He told her he had only shouted <i>"for luck."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run. Another
            tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes. The children
            awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed that it must be Wednesday or
            Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now, and that the search had been given
            over. He proposed to explore another passage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe
            and all other terrors. But Becky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary
            apathy and would not be roused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and
            die - it would not be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if
            he chose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak to her;
            and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would stay by her and
            hold her hand until all was over.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show of being
            confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave; then he took the
            kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the passages on his hands and
            knees, distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of coming doom.
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 32</h3>

        <p>
            TUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St. Petersburg
            still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public prayers had been
            offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer that had the
            petitioner's whole heart in it; but still no good news came from the cave. The
            majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily
            avocations, saying that it was plain the children could never be found. Mrs.
            Thatcher was very ill, and a great part of the time delirious. People said it
            was heartbreaking to hear her call her child, and raise her head and listen a
            whole minute at a time, then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly
            had drooped into a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white.
            The village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells, and in
            a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad people, who shouted,
            <i>"Turn out! turn out! they're found! they're found!"</i> Tin pans and horns
            were added to the din, the population massed itself and moved toward the river,
            met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens, thronged
            around it, joined its homeward march, and swept magnificently up the main street
            roaring huzzah after huzzah!
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the greatest night
            the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour a procession of
            villagers filed through Judge Thatcher's house, seized the saved ones and kissed
            them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher' s hand, tried to speak but couldn't - and drifted
            out raining tears all over the place.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Aunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly so. It would be
            complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the great news to
            the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon a sofa with an eager
            auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful adventure, putting in
            many striking additions to adorn it withal; and closed with a description of how
            he left Becky and went on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues
            as far as his kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest
            stretch of the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off
            speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it, pushed
            his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad Mississippi
            rolling by! And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that
            speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He told how
            he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her
            with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was going to die, and wanted
            to. He described how he labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost
            died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of
            daylight; how he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how
            they sat there and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and
            Tom hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition; how
            the men didn't believe the wild tale at first, <i>"because,"</i> said they,
            <i>"you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in"</i> -
            then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till
            two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were
            tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind them, and
            informed of the great news.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be shaken off
            at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were bedridden all of Wednesday
            and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and more tired and worn, all the time. Tom
            got about, a little, on Thursday, was down-town Friday, and nearly as whole as
            ever Saturday; but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she
            looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could not be
            admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday. He was admitted
            daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his adventure and introduce
            no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed. At home
            Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event; also that the <i>"ragged man's"</i> body
            had eventually been found in the river near the ferrylanding; he had been
            drowned while trying to escape, perhaps.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            About a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started off to visit
            Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting talk, and Tom
            had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge Thatcher's house was on
            Tom's way, and he stopped to see Becky. The Judge and some friends set Tom to
            talking, and some one asked him ironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave
            again. Tom said he thought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least doubt. But we
                have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any more."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Why?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and
                triple-locked - and I've got the keys."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Tom turned as white as a sheet.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"What's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!"</i>
        </p>

        <h3>Chapter 33</h3>

        <p>
            WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of men were on
            their way to McDougal's cave, and the ferryboat, well filled with passengers,
            soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim
            twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground, dead, with his
            face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing eyes had been fixed, to
            the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside. Tom
            was touched, for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had suffered. His
            pity was moved, but nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and
            security, now, which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully
            appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the
            day he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Injun Joe's bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great
            foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with tedious
            labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a sill outside it,
            and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage
            done was to the knife itself. But if there had been no stony obstruction there
            the labor would have been useless still, for if the beam had been wholly cut
            away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it.
            So he had only hacked that place in order to be doing something - in order to
            pass the weary time - in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one
            could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this
            vestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner had
            searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a few bats, and
            these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The poor unfortunate had
            starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a stalagmite had been slowly
            growing up from the ground for ages, builded by the water-drip from a stalactite
            overhead. The captive had broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had
            placed a stone, wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious
            drop that fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a
            clock-tick - a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was
            falling when the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome
            were laid when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the British
            empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was <i>"news."</i>
            It is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall have
            sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition, and been
            swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a
            mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for
            this flitting human insect's need? and has it another important object to
            accomplish ten thousand years to come? No matter. It is many and many a year
            since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops,
            but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that
            slow-dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of McDougal's cave. Injun
            Joe's cup stands first in the list of the cavern's marvels; even <i>"Aladdin's
            Palace"</i> cannot rival it.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked there in
            boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and hamlets for seven
            miles around; they brought their children, and all sorts of provisions, and
            confessed that they had had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral as they
            could have had at the hanging.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing - the petition to the
            governor for Injun Joe's pardon. The petition had been largely signed; many
            tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of sappy women been
            appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the governor, and implore him
            to be a merciful ass and trample his duty under foot. Injun Joe was believed to
            have killed five citizens of the village, but what of that? If he had been Satan
            himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names
            to a pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and
            leaky water-works.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have an
            important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom's adventure from the Welshman and
            the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned there was one thing
            they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted to talk about now. Huck's
            face saddened. He said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but whiskey.
                Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must 'a' ben you, soon as I
                heard 'bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you hadn't got the money becuz
                you'd 'a' got at me some way or other and told me even if you was mum to
                everybody else. Tom, something's always told me we'd never get holt of that
                swag."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. YOU know his tavern was all
                right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you remember you was to watch
                there that night?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Oh yes! Why, it seems 'bout a year ago. It was that very night that I
                follered Injun Joe to the widder's."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"YOU followed him?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Yes - but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends behind him, and I
                don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn't ben for me
                he'd be down in Texas now, all right."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only heard of
            the Welshman's part of it before.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Well,"</i> said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question,
            <i>"whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon -
                anyways it's a goner for us, Tom."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"What!"</i> Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. <i>"Tom, have you got on
            the track of that money again?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Huck, it's in the cave!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Huck's eyes blazed.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Say it again, Tom."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"The money's in the cave!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Tom - honest injun, now - is it fun, or earnest?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Earnest, Huck - just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in
                there with me and help get it out?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it and not get
                lost."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the
                world."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's --"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it I'll agree to
                give you my drum and every thing I've got in the world. I will, by jings."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"All right - it's a whiz. When do you say?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days, now,
                but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom - least I don't think I could."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck, but
                there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody but me know about. Huck, I'll
                take you right to it in a skiff. I'll float the skiff down there, and I'll pull
                it back again all by myself. You needn't ever turn your hand over."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Less start right off, Tom."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little bag or
                two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled things they
                call lucifer matches. I tell you, many's the time I wished I had some when I was
                in there before."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who was
            absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles below <i>"Cave
            Hollow,"</i> Tom said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the cave
                hollow - no houses, no woodyards, bushes all alike. But do you see that white
                place up yonder where there's been a landslide? Well, that's one of my marks.
                We'll get ashore, now."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            They landed.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I got out of
                with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly marched into a
            thick clump of sumach bushes and said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in this country. You
                just keep mum about it. All along I've been wanting to be a robber, but I knew
                I'd got to have a thing like this, and where to run across it was the bother.
                We've got it now, and we'll keep it quiet, only we'll let Joe Harper and Ben
                Rogers in - because of course there's got to be a Gang, or else there wouldn't
                be any style about it. Tom Sawyer's Gang - it sounds splendid, don't it,
                Huck?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Oh, most anybody. Waylay people - that's mostly the way."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"And kill them?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"What's a ransom?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Money. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends; and after
                you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you kill them. That's the
                general way. Only you don't kill the women. You shut up the women, but you don't
                kill them. They're always beautiful and rich, and awfully scared. You take their
                watches and things, but you always take your hat off and talk polite. They ain't
                anybody as polite as robbers - you'll see that in any book. Well, the women get
                to loving you, and after they've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop
                crying and after that you couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out
                they'd turn right around and come back. It's so in all the books."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Why, it's real bully, Tom. I believe it's better'n to be a pirate."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and circuses and
                all that."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in the
            lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then made their
            spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought them to the spring,
            and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him. He showed Huck the fragment of
            candle-wick perched on a lump of clay against the wall, and described how he and
            Becky had watched the flame struggle and expire.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and gloom of
            the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently entered and
            followed Tom's other corridor until they reached the <i>"jumping-off place."</i>
            The candles revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice, but only a
            steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet high. Tom whispered:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Now I'll show you something, Huck."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            He held his candle aloft and said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There - on the
                big rock over yonder - done with candle-smoke."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Tom, it's a CROSS!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"NOW where's your Number Two? 'UNDER THE CROSS,' hey? Right yonder's where I
                saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Tom, less git out of here!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"What! and leave the treasure?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Yes - leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there, certain."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place where he died -
                away out at the mouth of the cave - five mile from here."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"No, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of
                ghosts, and so do you."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in his mind. But
            presently an idea occurred to him --
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun Joe's ghost
                ain't a going to come around where there's a cross!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The point was well taken. It had its effect.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us, that cross is.
                I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended. Huck
            followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood
            in. The boys examined three of them with no result. They found a small recess in
            the one nearest the base of the rock, with a pallet of blankets spread down in
            it; also an old suspender, some bacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or
            three fowls. But there was no money-box. The lads searched and researched this
            place, but in vain. Tom said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"He said UNDER the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the cross.
                It can't be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the ground."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck could
            suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Lookyhere, Huck, there's footprints and some candle -grease on the clay
                about one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what's that for? I
                bet you the money IS under the rock. I'm going to dig in the clay."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"That ain't no bad notion, Tom!"</i> said Huck with animation.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Tom's <i>"real Barlow"</i> was out at once, and he had not dug four inches
            before he struck wood.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Hey, Huck! - you hear that?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and removed.
            They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock. Tom got into this
            and held his candle as far under the rock as he could, but said he could not see
            to the end of the rift. He proposed to explore. He stooped and passed under; the
            narrow way descended gradually. He followed its winding course, first to the
            right, then to the left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by,
            and exclaimed:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern, along with
            an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two or three pairs of
            old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish well soaked with the
            water-drip.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Got it at last!"</i> said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with his
            hand. <i>"My, but we're rich, Tom!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to believe, but we
                HAVE got it, sure! Say - let's not fool around here. Let's snake it out. Lemme
                see if I can lift the box."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward fashion, but
            could not carry it conveniently.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"I thought so,"</i> he said; <i>"THEY carried it like it was heavy, that day
            at the ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of fetching
            the little bags along."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross rock.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Now less fetch the guns and things,"</i> said Huck.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"No, Huck - leave them there. They're just the tricks to have when we go to
                robbing. We'll keep them there all the time, and we'll hold our orgies there,
                too. It's an awful snug place for orgies."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"What orgies?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've got to have
                them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a long time. It's getting late,
                I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll eat and smoke when we get to the skiff."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily out, found
            the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the skiff. As the sun
            dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got under way. Tom skimmed up the
            shore through the long twilight, chatting cheerily with Huck, and landed shortly
            after dark.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Now, Huck,"</i> said Tom, <i>"we'll hide the money in the loft of the
            widow's woodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count it and divide,
            and then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be safe.
            Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook Benny Taylor's
            little wagon; I won't be gone a minute."</i>
        </p>

            He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small sacks
            into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off, dragging his cargo
            behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman' s house, they stopped to rest.
            Just as they were about to move on, the Welshman stepped out and said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Hallo, who's that?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Huck and Tom Sawyer."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting. Here -
                hurry up, trot ahead - I'll haul the wagon for you. Why, it's not as light as it
                might be. Got bricks in it? - or old metal?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Old metal,"</i> said Tom.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more
                time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they
                would to make twice the money at regular work. But that's human nature - hurry
                along, hurry along!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas'."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Huck said with some apprehension - for he was long used to being falsely
            accused:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Mr. Jones, we haven't been doing nothing."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Welshman laughed.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Well, I don't know, Huck, my boy. I don't know about that. Ain't you and the
                widow good friends?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Yes. Well, she's ben good friends to me, anyway."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This question was not entirely answered in Huck's slow mind before he found
            himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas' drawing-room. Mr. Jones left
            the wagon near the door and followed.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence in the
            village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the Rogerses, Aunt
            Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great many more, and all
            dressed in their best. The widow received the boys as heartily as any one could
            well receive two such looking beings. They were covered with clay and
            candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson with humiliation, and frowned and
            shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did,
            however. Mr. Jones said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and Huck
                right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"And you did just right,"</i> said the widow. <i>"Come with me, boys."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            She took them to a bedchamber and said:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <i>"Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of clothes - shirts,
                socks, everything complete. They're Huck's - no, no thanks, Huck - Mr. Jones
                bought one and I the other. But they'll fit both of you. Get into them. We'll
                wait - come down when you are slicked up enough."</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Then she left.
        </p>
