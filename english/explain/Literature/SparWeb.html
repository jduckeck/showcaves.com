DESCRIPTION OF THE SPARRY CAVE IN SKYE.
</p>

<br/>

<p>
The Highland districts of Scotland have in all ages been considered interesting
from the peculiar manners of the inhabitants, and remarkable for the
characteristic wildness of the scenery.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The sterile aspect of those mountainous regions, rendered more formidable by a
dense atmosphere which almost perpetually hovers around them, seems uniformly to
have been regarded with astonishment and dread, and prevented even the intrepid
Romans, during their long possession of the southern provinces, from penetrating
into a country which appeared so cold and forbidding.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
With the dissemination of science, and the progressive advancement of the arts
in modern times, however, the means of traversing these lowering tracts have
become familiar, and strangers from all nations can readily gratify their
curiosity in exploring a part of the kingdom, which, even at a late era in its
history, was deemed inaccessible, because it was comparatively unknown to the
rest of the world.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
This propitious change, affecting in no less a degree the political sentiments,
than the civilization of the natives, has gradually raised them to importance as
faithful subjects of the State, worthy the fostering care of a wise and generous
legislature, while it has brought their long neglected land into some notice, as
an extensive field for improvement, deserving that attention which it has
received from a patriotic and munificent society of its countrymen.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
While this cause has ameliorated the condition of the Highlands in various
respects, it has at the same time opened to philosophical investigation, a
series of phenomena in natural history, which have been regarded as singular, as
they display the wonderful operations of nature under new and somewhat uncommon
arrangements.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The state of barbarism and obscurity in which the people of the Highlands were
immured in former ages, was a powerful barrier against the admission of useful
knowledge. Though constantly exposed to the contemplation of the sublime and
beautiful works of creation which surrounded them, they beheld those objects
with indifference, as their lives were more seriously devoted to other pursuits,
less refined, but more congenial with the rude and unsettled habits of the
times; and it was only when more polished maxims began to break through the
gloom, though by faint and languid rays, and when strangers from other places
were cordially received among them, that the grand features of their own
country, from the surprise which they raised in those visitors, also began to
excite their own admiration.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
A taste for science in general, having, by this intercourse, and different other
means, been diffused throughout the .Highlands, the natives, like those of other
countries, have acquired a relish for philosophical subjects, and in particular
for those of Geological inquiry, of which their country affords an ample and
interesting supply.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Among the various natural curiosities of the Highlands, which of late years have
attracted the notice of travellers, perhaps none has been examined of more
remarkable formation than the lately discovered Lime Spar Cave, near the point
of Strathaird, in the island of Skye, the most extensive of the Hebrides.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The magnificent appearance of this island in general, cannot fail to attract the
attention of strangers. The bold outline of its bleak and stupendous mountains,
when viewed from a distance at sea, in any direction, is exceedingly impressive,
and offers many subjects for the pencil, as well as numerous sources of
mineralogical research.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The grandeur of the prospect in approaching Skye from the south by sea, can
hardly be surpassed in any country. The great chain of mountains which stretch
from east to west, occupying a space exceeding fifteen leagues, presents to the
eye a tract which seems dark and gloomy, as the flat portions of the land are
lost in the deep shade of the hills. The granite, of which these immense masses
chiefly consist, being decomposed by long exposure to the air, has given a light
brown <span class="S-T2">colour</span> to their summits, which are totally
denuded of any vegetable covering.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
This incessant decay of substance is constantly washed down the declivities by
the rains, which being collected into impetuous cascades, carry with them in
their fall innumerable fragments of rocks and loose stones, every where to be
seen at the foot of the mountains, and which have rendered many of them bare,
almost to the base. The courses of these rapid streams are marked by many
channels, which give a striated, or streaked appearance to the sides of the
mountains, adding greatly to the picturesque effect of the scenery, and forming
a pleasing contrast with the green valleys, which, in getting nearer to the
shore, are seen to separate them from each other.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The regular horizontal line of the Island, which at a distance seemed entire and
undisturbed, is gradually broken into a multiplicity of promontories jutting far
into the ocean, and evince the propriety of its having been named the <span
class="S-T1">Winged Island, </span>as the word <span class="S-T1">Skianach
</span>in the G<span class="S-T3">&aelig;</span>lic language implies, and which has
been softened into the English&mdash;<span class="S-T1">Skye.</span>&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
But, in contemplating the general outline of this Island, the mind is
instinctively led to the consideration of those latent powers of nature which
have given shape to such a mighty structure, and formed that astonishing
collection of materials which compose the interior of those mountains.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
In the formation of the various mineral substances which this southern part of
Skye exhibits, water seems to have been the principal agent; but in attempting
to explain the different irregular appearances of the surface, which has
evidently undergone considerable revolutions subsequent to its primary
arrangement, the influence of fire must likewise be allowed to have had a
powerful effect, if not in the consolidation of the strata here exposed, at
least in the order which these now assume, not only throughout this island, but
also on every part of the west coast of Scotland, and the interior of the
Highlands.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The aqueous origin, however, of this particular Island, is rendered probable
from the stratified position of the rocks, and the numerous intermediate beds of
earth, sand, and fossils, of which it is every where composed.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
This modification is perceptible even in some of the hills which are of great
height, though it almost invariably appears that these several strata have been
thrown out of their supposed primeval disposition, having taken various
incurvations, and being irregularly fractured, and found in different degrees of
inclination with the horizon.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Whatever angle these strata present, as to their horizontal disposition, their
parallelism is for the most part accurately preserved during their visible
extent and the diversity of their curvations, and that, without regard to the
difference of their depth or breadth. From the vertical arrangement which some
of the strata on this coast exhibit, imbedded in rocks of a separate species and
character, their secondary nature is readily accounted for, and among these, the
trap, or whin, forms the principal examples in the island.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Besides the regular stratification of this coast in those places where our
observations were chiefly made, many of the eminencies are composed of primitive
matter, and unstratified rocks.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The vast collection of materials of which our globe is formed, is supposed
originally to have been in a state of fluidity. From this solution the various
substances are believed to have been deposited, and gradually hardened into
their present degree of solidity. Having given up these immense masses which
constitute our primary mountains, and the basis of the world, by some sudden
inscrutable process of crystalization, the water is conjectured to have retired
into the hollow parts, and excavations of the earth thus formed. As the water
continued to recede, it gave up what is called the secondary strata, until, by
successive precipitation, it finally retreated to its later boundaries, and left
the soil uncovered, and fit for the reception of man.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
This hypothesis is rendered still more conclusive, by the exposure of myriads of
shells, once the covering of marine animals, which are intermixed with, and
enveloped in different kinds of stone, common on these shores. The beautiful
figures and contexture of these fossils is still preserved in an unchanged
state, though they are intermingled in every imaginable variety. These animal
remains, formerly in the condition of organization, are also met with at a
distance from the shore, and many hundred feet above the level of the sea,
included in the solid rock, and retaining their original structure, but in a
state of complete petrifaction, totally deprived of their calcareous matter,and
having become equally compact and hard with the substance of the rocks of which
they now constitute a part.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Vegetable impressions are likewise to be seen in the composition of these
stones, and some of the most delicate fibres and foliage have even preserved
their configuration, though their nature has suffered such a transition.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
In further confirmation of this theory, it may be noticed, that, at a short
distance from this part of Skye immediately under consideration, several pieces
of the bones of land animals have lately been found in the most entire state of
preservation, deeply imbosomed in a stratum of compact limestone.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
To exemplify this geological principle in the construction of this island, many
other more minute proofs might be brought forward; but, in a cursory view like
the present, these to which we have adverted are deemed sufficient.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Were the stratified arrangement of this coast to be ascribed to the effects of
<span class="S-T1">fire, </span>that element must not only have acted in a
violent degree, but must also, from the appearances here exhibited, have been
applied at different times: and though this supposition should be admitted, yet
it is not probable that the same regularity of stratification now exposed could
have taken place, nor that, during the state of fusion, and the intensity of
heat which was necessary to be applied, these bones of land animals, these
marine fossils, and delicate vegetable substances, could have resisted the
consuming power of fire, and have retained the perfect, unchanged original shape
in which we here discover them.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
But to return from what may be deemed a digression:&mdash;The lofty mountains of
this island are for the most part, formed of granite, of a grey, or
brownish-grey colour, confused and shattered, and composed of crystals rudely
comparted. These granitic masses are commonly invested with micacious rock,
variously intersected with veins of basalt, trap, and limestone, frequently
running in one direction, but sometimes decussated, and irregularly inflected.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Some of the Skye mountains are composed of porphyry, the fracture of which is
smooth, and of various intensity and colours. This stone is here intermixed with
felspar, having its usual rhomboidal shape, and is also much intersected with
veins of trap.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Immense beds of sandstone rock, varying in hardness and colour, abound
throughout the whole of this island, particularly on the south east. These veins
are often surmounted with vast strata of basalt, in many places assuming the
columnar form, and rising to a very considerable height above the surface of the
sea. Some of these basaltic rocks appear with huge distortions, detached from
each other in confused blocks, and elevated pyramids. The disintegrations of
these craggy precipices, have, in many instances, overspread the plains, which
are covered with fragments that have rolled down the declivities, in the manner
of the Alpine Avalanches.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
This island has also been lately noted for extensive bodies of lime spar, or
marble, which were discovered in different places. Some of this marble is of
great beauty, and of various shades, not inferior in whiteness to Parian, but
neither so pure, nor of a texture so compact as that of Carrara.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
At one place, near the harbour of Broadford, we remarked an unusual
stratification of granite, and of micacious rock. These, though of declared
primitive, and secondary formation, are closely approximated, and have a course
parallel to each other. They seem to come directly from the lofty Ben-caillich,
and are suddenly lost in the sea, which washes the northern base of that
mountain.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
But the principal object of curiosity which this island possesses, .and which we
purpose to make the chief subject of our remarks, is the Lime Spar Cave, lately
discovered on the south-eastern shore. This phenomenon will neither be deemed
unworthy of notice, nor uninteresting to the traveller, who pursues his course
to contemplate nature in her grand and complicated operations.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The Cave, as has already been observed, is situated in that division of Skye,
called Strathaird, on the farm of Glashnakill, and near the cape or promontory
of Rhu-na-heskan&mdash;<span class="S-T1">(the point of eels,} </span>in
approaching to Loch Slappen, which runs up among the mountains in a northerly
direction. It is in latitude 57&deg; 6<span class="S-T4">'</span> north; about 6&deg;
20<span class="S-T4">'</span> longitude west of London, and 3&deg; 2<span
class="S-T4">'</span> west of the meridian of Edinburgh. From the point of
Ardnamurchan, the most westerly part of the main-land of Scotland, it lies north
and by east, distant about twelve leagues.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
This portion of Strathaird is more limited in its extent than the other
divisions of the island, and not of extraordinary elevation near the shore,
which is steep and rocky. From the coast, the land converges by a gentle
acclivity, which, at some distance, is suddenly broken off by a ridge of basalt,
forming a hill of considerable eminence, but which soon falls off by a gradual
descent towards the high land. Behind this hill, to the north and northwest,
rise the sable mountains of Cuthulin and Blavin, rearing their ragged pinnacles
to the clouds, and frowning in awful majesty over the herds, who, heedless of
their dignity, brouse the scanty herbage from their sides.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The whole coast of Strathaird is bold and precipitous. Rising directly from the
sea, it presents, along its entire course, an almost unbroken line of
perpendicular rock, but of unequal altitude. The arrangement is the most
romantic that can be supposed, the whole shore being indented with caves and
grottos of many forms, and rocks piled into various grotesque and elegant
structures: And if this country afforded no other source of amusement, the
prospect of this shore alone, will amply repay the traveller's toil.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
This shore is principally composed of argillaceous sandstone of regular
stratification, nearly horizontal; but it has been so completely fractured, and
divided by innumerable perpendicular fissures, that it appears as if vertically
stratified, each stratum reclining somewhat towards the west, and following a
line from north-west to southeast. These seemingly fortuitous strata are
separated by numerous beds of trap, or what are commonly known by the name of
<span class="S-T1">whin dykes, </span>of various sizes, running in a parallel
direction, but with different degrees of alternation; keeping their invariable
course, which is also from north-west to south-east, a tract which the whin
strata always maintain over the west coast of Scotland, from the Firth of Clyde
to Cape Wrath.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
This sandstone is of a greyish, or brownish-grey colour, of a multiplicity of
layers closely arranged, and sometimes of different shades, which dip towards
the north with a small inclination; and where this stone is subjected to the
simultaneous action of the air and the salt water, it exposes an irregular
striated surface, which renders it unsuitable to architectural purposes.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The mouth of the cave has been known to the people in its vicinity, time out of
memory: But it was not till June 1808 that it was explored, by the persevering
zeal of Mrs. Gillespie at Kilmoree. This Lady is not a native of Skye; but from
the marvellous stories she had heard of this Cave, she was desirous of examining
it. She accordingly took with her a boat and hands, and succeeded to her utmost
wish. The account which she gave of it, afterwards induced the proprietor,
accompanied by this Lady and her husband, to visit it, and the farther they
advanced, the more were they gratified and astonished with what they saw. To
Mrs. Gillespie, then, is the public indebted for the discovery of this justly
celebrated Cave, which, but for her laudable curiosity, might still have
remained unknown. If the traveller has the good fortune of getting acquainted
with the kind family of Mr. Gillespie at Kilmoree, his journey will be greatly
and most agreeably facilitated.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The Cave has received the name of <span class="S-T1">Slochd Altrimen,
</span>which, in the language of the country, signifies, the <span
class="S-T1">Nursling Cave, </span>or the cavity where the child was
preserved.&mdash;An ancient tradition furnishes the tale from which we may
suppose the Cave has derived its name.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
At a distant period of Scottish History, Skye, and the whole Hebride Isles, were
under the dominion of Norwegian princes. Whether these people were the original
possessors, or whether they overcame and drove away the former inhabitants, it
is unnecessary to inquire; but these islands long remained under their
jurisdiction, and their conquests were extended to many provinces of the main
land.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
They bestowed upon the different islands, and other parts which they occupied,
Scandinavian names, many of which are still retained. As their population
increased, they became a warlike race, and occasionally scattered their
adventures over the neighbouring coasts; but their efforts were chiefly directed
against Ireland, whose inhabitants were always their declared enemies.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
At this time, though the Western Islands were nominally under the controul of
one sovereign, they were possessed, by numerous independent lords, each of whom
supported his own tribe, and waged war against his neighbours as best suited his
views and his strength.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Our tradition will have it, that, about the beginning of the ninth century,
MacCairbre, king of Ulster, having assembled a great fleet, set sail for the
Hebride Isles. Arriving unexpectedly, he committed barbarous and wanton
cruelties, ravaging the Islands for many days. Having loaded his ships with
plunder, he departed without opposition, the native princes being absent with
their king Aulaive of Norway, engaged in a contest with the Picts. On their
return to Ulster, a storm arose, which forced the fleet of MacCairbre to seek
shelter in the island of Colonsay. The chief of this Island, though compelled to
subjection by the Norwegian kings, was attached to this prince of Ireland from
ties of consanguinity. He received the strangers with kindness, and entertained
them until the storm abated. Before they departed, the chief of Colonsay
declared fealty to the king of Ulster, and to prove his attachment, sent his
only son to Ireland, accompanied by a chosen band, along with MacCairbre, to
learn the art of war.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The deadly feuds which long prevailed betwixt the chiefs of the Isles and those
of Ireland, became even more inveterate by this invasion from Ulster. Determined
on revenge, the Lords of Skye, with other powerful allies, assembled their
tribes, and embarked in an hundred vessels for an attack upon Ulster. With a
favouring gale they arrived on the coast of Ireland, and having disembarked in
the night, immediately beset the fortress of MacCairbre. A bloody conflict
ensued. The king of Ulster and many of his people were slain. Nor were the men
of the Isles more fortunate. Several of their chiefs were laid low; but the
troops of Ulster were vanquished, and their severities retaliated.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Having completed their revenge, they returned to their barks, carrying with them
the king of Ulster's daughter, many of his warriors, and among them the young
chief of Colonsay, as proofs of their victory. Propitious winds seemed to favour
their course. They soon beheld the towering cliffs of their native mountains,
which they were rapidly approaching, and gladness, mingled indeed with sorrow
for their friends who had fallen, filled their hearts.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
On the evening of the fourth day, a calm prevailed over the face of the ocean.
The white sails of the fleet were reflected from its unruffled bosom, as the
sun's last beam sunk beneath the western wave. The mournful song of the rowers,
as they plied the steady oar, resounded far over the expanse. The returning
fleet was descried from the shores of Skye, and their anxious relatives
anticipated a safe arrival. Disappointment, however, awaited their hopes. In the
night, a dreadful storm succeeded the calm, and with the morning dawn, one only
sail was to be seen. This bark rode triumphantly over the waves, and seemed to
baffle the efforts of the gale. She steered her course for Slappen's hilly
shore, but there arose over a reef of rocks which stretch far off the land, a
tremendous sea. Thither the current swept the vessel, and she was quickly
overwhelmed in the foaming surge. Hope now fled the breast of the fair
Dounhuila, who, from the turrets of her father's castle, beheld the horrors of
the storm. Her brother had gone with the warriors of Skye, and despair laid hold
of her heart. Her parents too gazed over the scene, and their anguish was
severe. Their sorrowful eyes still fixed upon the deep, they saw some object
floating towards the shore. Dounhuila fled to the beach. She beheld a young man
almost lifeless, brought to land by a dog; but, alas! it was not her brother. It
was the young chief of Colonsay, but she knew him not. Pity assumed unwonted
softness in her countenance, and the mild lustre of her dark brown eyes declared
the tenor of her mind. Collecting her father's vassals, the young chief of
Colonsay was conveyed to Dunglas, a fortress whose remains are still visible
near the Sparry Cave. Dounhuila's brother returned in safety, as did many of his
shipwrecked warriors, and joy filled the halls of Dunglas; but the fair daughter
of Ulster was seen no more.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The lovely Dounhuila with pleasure beheld the returning strength of the youthful
stranger. She was his guardian spirit, and mutual attachment grew in their
hearts. But, when the young warrior made himself known to Dounhuila, an
unsurmountable barrier seemed to forbid their love. Their parents were
determined foes, and the young chieftain, though kindly treated, was in the Lord
of Dunglas' power, and was strictly guarded. Confined within the Castle walls
for many months, he remained unknown to all except Dounhuila. With a form of
exquisite symmetry, yet with simple manners and an unsuspicious heart, and more
the victim of love than the child of prudence. she became pregnant. The horror
of her situation daily increased. Concealment appeared impossible. The disgrace
which seemed inevitable, preyed upon her spirits, and melancholy deeply marked
her features. She knew her father's proud heart and implacable disposition, and
that certain death awaited the unhappy pair the moment her situation was known.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
It happened fortunately at this time, that the Lords of the Hebrides were
summoned to Norway, to assist their king in repelling an invasion from Saxony.
The chief of Dunglas, with his son, assembled their warriors, and departed for
that country, leaving the charge of the Castle and their prisoners to a few
vassals of tried fidelity. In their absence Dounhuila prevailed with the
soldiers, her lover was permitted to depart, and he set sail for Colonsay.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Dounhuila was delivered of a son, and, being aided by a trusty domestic, the
child was conveyed to the Cave on the sea-shore to prevent discovery. The
difficulty of access to this retirement rendered it secure from intrusion; the
entrance was guarded by the young chief of Colonsay's faithful dog he had left
behind, and here Dounhuila regularly retired to nurse her son. The family feuds
of Dunglas and Colonsay in time had ceased. A happy union of the lovers took
place, and this child of the cave was permitted to emerge from his dreary
nursery (see the annexed Poem); and hence the origin of its name.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
THOUGH the entrance to <span class="S-T1">Slochd Altrimen </span>has long been
familiar to the natives of this country, none of them, as has been stated, had
the curiosity, or, perhaps from superstitious notions, no one had the courage to
explore its recesses, until the period to which we formerly adverted. Common
report indeed, says that, several years since, five men had gone into it, but
never returned, and the belief of this story increased the unwillingness of the
country people to come near the place, far less to examine it.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The superstition, which, in the early ages of the Highlands, prevailed so
generally, descended in regular succession, from one generation to another, and,
to a very late period of their history, continued to influence the mind and
conduct in so powerful a manner, that the ordinary incidents of life were, by
some means or other, construed to depend upon sorcery, witchcraft, or the second
sight.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The shores of the Highlands abound in cavernous recesses, and the perpetual
darkness which dwells in those gelid and dreary mansions, added strength to the
superstitious fears of the natives, and marked these caves as the certain abodes
of malignant spirits, and supernatural beings, which consequently precluded
their being thoroughly examined.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
These fears were equally groundless and absurd; but surely in the formation of a
cave so magnificent as that of <span class="S-T1">Slochd Altrimen, </span>the
reflecting mind must naturally look up to the agency of a power beyond the
comp
