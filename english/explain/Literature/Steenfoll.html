        <h2 class="center"><b class="smallCaps">William Haufs</b></h2>

        <br class="clear">

        <p>
            On one of Scotland’s rocky islands, there dwelt many years ago, two fishermen, who lived in complete harmony.
            Both were unmarried; neither of them had any relatives living; and their common labor, although differently directed, sufficed to support them both.
            They were of about the same age, but in person and disposition they resembled each other as little as do an eagle and a sea-calf.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Kaspar Strumpf was a short, stout man, with a broad, fat, full-moon face, and good-natured, laughing eyes, to which sorrow and care appeared to be strangers.
            He was not only fat, but sleepy and lazy as well; and therefore the house work, cooking and baking, and repairing of nets for the capture of fish for their own table and for the market, devolved on him, as well as a large part of the cultivation of the small field attached to their cabin.
            Quite the opposite was his companion–tall and lank, with Roman nose and keen eyes; he was known as the most industrious and luckiest fisherman, the most daring cliff-climber after birds and down, the hardest field worker, on the whole island.
            Besides all this, he was considered the keenest trader on the Kirkwall market; but as his wares were good, and his transactions above reproach, every one dealt willingly with him.
            Thus William Falcon and Kaspar Strumpf–with whom the former, avaricious as he was, freely divided his hardly-earned gains–not only made a good living, but were in a fair way of acquiring a certain degree of wealth.
            But a competence would not satisfy Falcon’s covetous soul; he wanted to be rich, extremely rich, and as he had already found out that riches accumulate but slowly in the usual course of industry, he at last settled into the conviction that he should have to attain his riches through some extraordinary stroke of fortune.
            When this idea had once taken possession of his mind, there was no room left for any thing else, and he began to talk this shadowy windfall over with Kaspar Strumpf, as though it had already come to pass.
            Kaspar, who received everything that Falcon said as scripture, repeated all this to his neighbors: and so the report was spread abroad that William Falcon had either sold his soul to the evil one, or had at least received an offer for it from the prince of the infernal regions.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At first, these reports caused much amusement to Falcon; but gradually he began to entertain the notion that a spirit might sometime reveal a treasure to him, and he no longer contradicted his acquaintances when they twitted him on the subject.
            He continued his usual occupations, but with far less zeal than before, and often consumed a great part of the time, that he had formerly passed in fishing or other useful avocations, in idle search for some kind of an adventure by which he should suddenly become rich.
            To still further complete this unfortunate tendency of his mind, it happened that as he was standing one day on the lonely sea-shore, looking out on the restless sea as if he were expecting his good fortune would come from thence, a large wave rolled a yellow ball to his feet amongst a mass of moss and loosened stone–a ball of gold!
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Falcon stood as if bewitched.
            His hopes, then, had not been unsubstantial dreams; the sea had given him gold, beautiful shining gold, the fragment probably of a heavy bar of gold which the sea had rolled on its bottom into the size and shape of a musket ball.
            And now it was clear to his mind that somewhere on this coast there must have been a treasure ship wrecked, and that he had been selected as the chosen one to raise this buried treasure from the sea.
            From this time forth, this search for treasure became the passion of his life.
            He strove to conceal the golden nugget even from his friend, so that others might not discover his purpose.
            He neglected everything else, and spent his days and nights on this coast, not casting his net for fishes, but throwing out a scoop, that he had specially prepared for the purpose, for gold.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But he found poverty instead of wealth; for he earned nothing now himself, and Kaspar’s sleepy efforts would not support them both.
            In the search for the larger mass of gold, not only the nugget was used up, but the entire property of the two men as well.
            But as Strumpf had formerly received the largest part of his living by Falcon’s efforts, taking it all as a matter of course, so now he looked on the profitless undertaking of his friend silently and without a murmur; and it was just this meek forbearance on the part of his friend that spurred Falcon on to continue his restless search for wealth.
            But what made him still more active in his search was, that as often as he laid down to rest and closed his eyes in sleep, a word was sounded in his ear that he seemed to have heard very plainly, and that always appeared to be the same word, and yet he could never recall it.
            To be sure, he did not see what connection this circumstance, singular as it was, might have with his present purpose; but upon a spirit like William Falcon’s everything made an impression, and even this mysterious whisper helped to strengthen his belief that great good luck was in store for him, which he expected to find only in a heap of gold.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            One day he was surprised by a storm on the shore in the same place where he had found the nugget, and he was forced to take refuge from its fury in a cave near by.
            This cave, which the inhabitants called the cave of Steenfoll, consists of a long underground passage opening on the sea, with two entrances, and permitting a free passage of the waves that were continually foaming through them with a loud roar.
            This cave could be entered only from one place–through a fissure from above, that was but seldom approached except by venturesome boys, as in addition to the natural dangers of the spot, the cavern was reported to be haunted.
            Falcon let himself down through this opening with some difficulty, for about twelve feet, and took a seat on a projecting piece of rock beneath an overhanging ledge, where, with the roaring waves beneath his feet and the raging storm above his head, he fell into his usual train of thought about the wrecked ship and what kind of a ship it might have been; for in spite of all his inquiries, he could not obtain any information of a vessel having been wrecked on this spot, even from the oldest
            inhabitants.
            How long he sat thus he did not know himself; but when he finally awoke from his reveries, he found that the storm was over, and he was about to clamber up again, when a voice from out of the depths pronounced the word ” Car-milhan ” very distinctly.
            He climbed up to the top again, and looked down into the abyss once more in great terror.
            “Great Heavens!” exclaimed he, “that is the word that disturbs my sleep! What does it mean?” ” Carmilhan! ” was the sighing response that came once more from the cave; and he fled to his hut like a frightened deer.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Falcon was no coward; his fright was more from surprise than fear; and, more than this, the greed for gold was too powerful in him to allow of his being easily driven from his dangerous path.
            Once, as he was fishing with his scoop for treasure by moonlight, opposite the cave of Steenfoll, his scoop caught on something.
            He pulled with all his strength, but the mass was immovable.
            In the meantime the wind had risen, dark clouds overcast the sky, the boat rocked and threatened to turn over; but Falcon did not lose his presence of mind; he pulled and pulled at his scoop until the resistance ceased, and as he felt no weight he concluded that his rope had broken.
            But just as the clouds were about to obscure the moon’s light, a round, black mass appeared on the surface of the water, and the word that haunted him, ” Carmilhan,” was spoken.
            He made a quick effort to seize the object; but as soon as he stretched out his arm it disappeared in the darkness, and the coming storm forced him to seek protection under the rocks near by.
            Here, overcome by exhaustion, he fell asleep, only to be tormented in dreams by an unbridled imagination, and to suffer anew the pangs experienced in his waking hours, caused by his restless search for wealth.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            When Falcon waked, the first rays of the rising sun fell upon the bosom of the sea, as smooth now as a mirror.
            He was just about to set out on his accustomed work, when he saw something coming towards him from the distance.
            He soon recognized it as a boat.
            Within it sat a human figure; but what aroused his greatest astonishment was that the vessel came on without the aid of sail or oar, and its prow pointed for land without the person sitting in the boat paying any attention to the rudder, if there were one.
            The boat came nearer, and finally stopped near William’s boat.
            Its occupant proved to be a little dried-up old man, dressed in yellow linen, and wearing a red peaked night-cap.
            His eyes were closed, and he sat as motionless as a mummy.
            After vainly shouting at him and jarring the boat.
            Falcon was in the act of making a line fast to the boat to tow it off, when the little man opened his eyes, and began to bestir himself in such a manner as to fill even the bold fisherman’s mind with dread.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Where am I?” asked he in Dutch, after a deep sigh.
            Falcon who had learned something of that language from the Dutch herring-fishermen, told him the name of the island, and inquired who he was and what errand brought him here.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I have come to look for the Carmilhan.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “The Carmilhan ? for Heaven’s sake, what is that?” cried the curious fisherman.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I won’t give an answer to questions addressed to me in such a manner,” replied the little man.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Well then,” shouted Falcon, “what is the Carmilhan ?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “The Carmilhan is nothing now; but once it was a beautiful ship, carrying more gold than ever a vessel carried before.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Where was it wrecked, and when?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “It was a hundred years ago; where, I do not know exactly.
            I come to search for the spot and recover the lost gold; if you will help me we will divide what we find.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “With my whole heart; only tell me what I must do.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “What you will have to do requires courage.
            You must go just before midnight to the wildest and loneliest region on the island, leading a cow, which you must slaughter there, and get some one to wrap you up in the cow’s fresh hide.
            Your companion must then lay you down and leave you alone, and before it strikes one o’clock you will know where the treasures of the Carmilhan lies.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “It was in just such a way that old Engrol was destroyed, body and soul!” cried Falcon, with horror.
            “You are the evil one himself,” continued he as he rowed quickly away.
            “Go back to hell! I won’t have anything to do with you.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The little man gnashed his teeth, and cursed him; but Falcon, who had seized both oars, was soon out of hearing, and on turning round a rocky promontory was out of sight as well.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But the discovery that the evil one was taking advantage of his avarice by seeking to ensnare him with gold, did not open the eyes of the blinded fisherman, but on the contrary he determined to make use of the information the little man had given him, without putting himself in the power of the evil one.
            So while he continued to fish for gold on the desolate coast, he neglected the prosperity offered by large schools of fish off other parts of the coast as well as all other expedients to which he had once turned his attention, and sank with his companion into deeper poverty from day to day, until the common necessaries of life began to fail them.
            But although this ruin might be wholly ascribed to Falcon’s obstinacy and cupidity, and the maintenance of both had fallen on Kaspar Strumpf alone, yet the latter never once reproached his companion, but on the other hand continued to display the same subjection to him, and the same confidence in his superior understanding, as at the time when everyone of his undertakings was successful.
            This circumstance increased Falcon’s sorrows not a little, but drove him into a still keener search for gold, hoping thereby soon to be able to indemnify his companion for so great forbearance.
            The word Carmilhan still haunted him in his sleep.
            In short, need, disappointed hopes, and avarice, drove him finally into a species of insanity, so that he really resolved to do that which the little man had advised–although knowing that, as the legend ran, he thereby gave himself up to the powers of darkness.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Kaspar’s objections were all in vain.
            Falcon became the more determined, the more Kaspar besought him to give up his desperate purpose; and finally the good, weak-minded fellow consented to accompany him and assist him in carrying out his plan.
            The hearts of both men were saddened, as they tied a rope to the horns of a beautiful cow that they had owned since she was a calf, and that was now their last piece of property; they had often refused to sell her before, because they could not bear the thought of letting her go into strange hands.
            But the evil spirit that now controlled Falcon’s actions triumphed over his better nature; nor did Kaspar know how to restrain him in anything.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            It was now September, and the long nights of the Scottish Winter had already begun.
            The night clouds were driven along before the raw night wind, and were banked up in masses like icebergs.
            Deep shadows filled the ravines between the mountains and the peat-bogs, and the troubled channels of the streams appeared black and fearful.
            Falcon led the way and Strumpf followed, shuddering at his own boldness.
            Tears filled Kaspar’s eyes as often as he looked at the poor creature that was going so unconsciously and trustfully to its death, to be dealt it by the hand that had always fed and caressed it.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            With much difficulty they entered a narrow marshy valley, which was here and there strewn with rocks, with patches of moss and heathers, and was shut in by a chain of wild mountains whose outlines were lost in a gray mist, and whose steep sides had seldom been ascended by a human foot.
            They approached a large rock in the centre of the valley over the shaking bog, from which a frightened eagle flew screaming into the sky.
            The poor cow lowed, as if aware of the terrors of the place and the fate that awaited her.
            Kaspar turned aside to wipe away the fast falling tears.
            He looked down to the rocky opening through which they had come, from which point could be heard the breakers on the distant coast, and then up to the mountain peaks, upon which a coal-black cloud had settled, from which might be heard from time to time dull mutterings of thunder.
            As he looked toward Falcon he found that his friend had made the cow fast to the rock, and now stood with uplifted ax in the very act of dealing her death blow.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This was too much for Kaspar.
            Wringing his hands, he fell upon his knees.
            “For God’s sake, William Falcon!” shouted he in despairing tones, “save yourself! Spare the cow! Save yourself and me! Save your soul! Save your life! And if you will persist in tempting God, wait at least until to-morrow and sacrifice some other animal than our own cow!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Kaspar, are you crazy?” shrieked Falcon, like a madman, while he still held the ax swinging in the air.
            “Shall I spare the cow and starve?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “You shall not starve,” answered Kaspar, resolutely.
            “As long as I have hands you shall not suffer hunger.
            I will work for you day and night, so that you do not endanger the peace of your soul, and let the poor creature live for my sake!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Then take the ax and split my head!” shouted Falcon, in desperation.
            “I won’t move from this spot until I have what I desire.
            Can you raise the treasures of the Carmilhan for me? Can your hands earn more than the merest necessaries of life? But you can put an end to my misery.
            Come, and let me be the victim!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “William, kill the cow, kill me! It does not matter to me, I was only anxious about the salvation of your soul.
            Alas! this was the altar of the Picts, and the sacrifice that you would bring belongs to the darkness.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I don’t know anything about that,” cried Falcon, laughing wildly, like one who is resolved not to listen to anything that might swerve him from his purpose.
            “Kaspar, you are crazy and make me crazy, too.
            But there,” continued he, throwing away the ax and picking up his knife from the stone as if about to stab himself; “there, I will kill myself instead of the cow!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Kaspar was at his side in a twinkling, tore the murderous weapon from his hand, seized the ax, poised it high in the air, and brought it down with such a force on the poor cow’s head, that she fell dead at her master’s feet.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A flash of lightning, accompanied by a peal of thunder, followed this rash act, and Falcon stared at his friend in astonishment.
            But Strumpf was disturbed neither by the thunder-clap nor by the fixed stare of his companion; and without speaking a word, fell to work at removing the hide.
            When Falcon had recovered from his amazement, he assisted his companion at this task, but with as evident aversion as he had before manifested eagerness to see the sacrifice completed.
            During their work the thunder-storm had gathered, the thunder reverberated among the mountains, and fearful flashes played about the rock; while the wind roared through the lower valleys and along the coast.
            And when at last the two fishermen had stripped the hide off, they found that they were wet through to the skin.
            They spread the hide out on the ground, and Kaspar wrapped and tied Falcon up in it.
            Then, for the first time, when all this was done, poor Kaspar broke the long silence by saying in a trembling voice, as he looked down at his deluded friend: “Can I do anything more for you, William?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Nothing more,” replied the other; “farewell!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Farewell,” responded Kaspar.
            “God be with you, and pardon you, as I do.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            These were the last words Falcon heard from him, for Kaspar disappeared in the darkness; and immediately thereafter the most terrible thunder-storm occurred that William had ever experienced.
            It began with a flash, that revealed to Falcon’s sight not only the mountains and rocks in his immediate vicinity, but also the valley below, with the foaming sea and the rocky islets in the bay, between which he thought he had a vision of a large foreign ship, dismasted; though the sight was instantly lost again in the inky darkness.
            The thunder-claps were deafening.
            A mass of splintered rock rolled down the mountain-side and threatened to crush him.
            The rain poured down in such torrents that the narrow, marshy valley was flooded with a stream that soon reached to Falcon’s shoulders; fortunately Kaspar had laid him with the upper part of his body on a slight elevation, else he would surely have drowned.
            The water rose still higher, and the more Falcon exerted himself to get out of his dangerous situation, the tighter did the hide seem to wrap itself about his limbs.
            All in vain did he call for Kaspar.
            Kaspar was far away.
            He did not dare to call on God in his distress, and a shudder ran through his frame whenever he thought of appealing for assistance to the powers into whose clutches he was conscious of having delivered himself.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Already the water crept into his ears; now it touched the edge of his lips.
            “Oh, God! I am lost!” screamed he, as he felt the water sweep over his face; but in the same instant the sound of a waterfall close by came dimly to his ears, and his face was immediately uncovered.
            The flood had forced a passage through the stone; and as the rain slackened and the sky grew lighter, so did his despair abate, and a ray of hope returned to his mind.
            But although he felt as exhausted as if just emerged from a death-struggle, and ardently wished to be released from his imprisonment, still the purpose of his desperate efforts was not yet accomplished, and with the vanishing of immediate deadly peril, the demon of greed returned to his breast.
            But, convinced that he must remain in his present situation in order to attain his end, he kept very quiet, and finally, overcome by cold and exhaustion, fell into a sound sleep.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            He might have slept two hours, when a cold wind blowing over his face, and a roaring, as of oncoming waves, aroused him from his happy state of oblivion.
            The sky was darkened anew.
            A flash, like that which had ushered in the first storm, lighted up once more the surrounding region, and he fancied he had another vision of the strange ship, that was now poised for an instant on the crest of an enormous wave close to the Steenfoll cliffs, and then appeared to shoot suddenly into the rocky chasm.
            He continued to stare after the phantom, as the sea was now illuminated by unceasing flashes of lightning, when suddenly a water-spout rose from the valley, near where he lay, and dashed him so violently against a rock as to deprive him of his senses.
            When he recovered consciousness, the weather had cleared, the sky was bright, but the lightning still continued.
        </p>

            He lay close at the base of the mountains that shut in this valley, feeling so badly bruised that he had no desire to stir.
            He heard the quieter beating of the surf, mingled with a solemn melody like that of a psalm.
            These tones were at first so faint that he thought they must be an illusion; but they occurred again and again, each time clearer and nearer, and at last he thought he could distinguish the melody of a psalm which he had heard on board a Dutch fishing-smack the Summer before.
            Finally he could also make out voices, and he seemed to be able to distinguish the words of the song.
            The voices were now in the valley, and he pushed himself, with difficulty, to a stone, upon which he raised his head, and perceived a procession of human figures, evidently the singers he had heard, and who were coming directly towards him.
            Care and grief were expressed on the faces of these people; and water was dripping from their clothes.
            Now they were close to him, and their song ceased.
            At their head were several musicians; then followed some seamen, and after these came a tall and strong man in a costume richly decorated with gold, apparently belonging to a past age.
            A sword hung at his side, and he carried in his hand a stout Spanish cane with a gold head.
            At his left side walked a negro boy, who, from time to time, handed his master a long-stemmed pipe, from which the latter would take several grave puffs and then walk on.
            He stopped bolt upright before Falcon, while other men, less splendidly dressed, ranged themselves on either side of him.
            They all had pipes in their hands, not, however, as costly as that of their leader.
            Behind them came still other persons, among them being several women, some of whom had children in their arms or at their apron-strings, and all in costly foreign costumes.
            A crowd of Dutch sailors brought up the rear of the procession, each one having a quid of tobacco in his mouth, and holding between his teeth a little cutty-pipe, which he smoked in gloomy silence.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The fisherman shuddered as he looked at this singular assembly; but his expectation that something would come of it all kept his courage up.
            For some time the strange people stood around him thus, and the smoke from their pipes floated over them like a cloud, through which peeped the stars.
            The men closed in on Falcon in an ever-narrowing circle; the smoking became more and more vehement, and the clouds that arose from pipe and mouth increased in density.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Falcon was a bold, daring man; he had prepared himself beforehand for extraordinary occurrences; but when he saw this innumerable crowd pressing in on him as if to crush him by their numbers, his courage failed him, great drops of sweat stood out on his forehead, and he thought he would perish in a spasm of fright.
            But one may imagine his horror when, as he chanced to turn his eyes, he saw, sitting motionless and erect, close by his head, the little old man in the yellow linen suit, looking just as he had the first time except that now, as if making fun of the whole assembly, he, too, had a pipe in his mouth.
            In the mortal fright that now took possession of him, Falcon cried out to the leader of this assembly:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “In the name of whomsoever you serve, who are you? and what do you want with me?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tall man drew three whiffs, even more gravely than before; then gave the pipe to his servant and answered very coldly:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I am Alfred Frank van Swelder, commander of the ship Carmilhan, of Amsterdam, which, on the voyage home from Batavia, went to the bottom with man and mouse on this rocky coast.
            These are my officers, those my passengers, and beyond, my brave crew who were all drowned with me.
            Why have you summoned us from our dwellings deep in the sea? Why do you disturb our rest?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I wish to know where the treasure of the Carmilhan lies.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “On the bottom of the sea.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Where?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “In the cave of Steenfoll.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “How can I recover it?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “A goose dives into the abyss for a herring; is not the treasure of the Carmilhan of as much value?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “How much of it shall I recover?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “More than you will ever spend.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The little man in yellow grinned horribly at this reply, while all the others laughed aloud.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Are you through?” inquired the commander, further.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I am.
            Farewell!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Farewell, until we meet again!” replied the Dutchman, and turned to go; the musicians took the lead again, and the whole procession marched away in the same order in which it had come, and with the same solemn song, which grew ever fainter and fainter in the distance, until finally it was lost in the roar of the breakers.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Falcon now exerted his utmost strength to get out of the hide, and he at last succeeded in freeing one arm, with which he was able to loosen the rope that was wound round him, and soon had stepped out of the hide.
            Without stopping to look about him, he hastened down to his hut, and found poor Kaspar Strumpf lying on the ground in an insensible condition.
            With some difficulty he restored him to consciousness, and the good fellow shed tears of joy on once more beholding the friend of his youth, whom he had given up for lost.
            But this happy consolation vanished quickly, when he learned what a desperate undertaking Falcon now had in mind.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I would rather cast myself into hell than to look any longer at these bare walls and reflect on our misery.
            Follow me, or stay here; I am going at any rate.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            With these words Falcon seized a torch, a tinder-box, and a rope, and hastened away.
            Kaspar ran after him as fast as he could, and found his friend standing on the ledge of the rock upon which he had once sought safety from the storm, and ready to let himself down into the raging abyss.
            When Kaspar found that his entreaties had no effect on the crazed man, he prepared to descend after him; but Falcon ordered him to remain where he was and hold on to the rope.
            With an amount of exertion that could only have been supplied by the blindest of passions, greed, Falcon clambered down into the cave, and at last came to a projecting piece of rock, just below which the black waves, crested with foam, rushed along with a dreadful roar.
            He looked about him eagerly, and finally saw something glistening in the water directly beneath where he stood.
            He laid down his torch, plunged in, and seized a heavy object which he managed to bring back with him.
            It was an iron box filled with gold pieces.
            He shouted up to his companion what he had found; but he would not pay the least attention to Kaspar’s entreaties to content himself with what he had.
            Falcon believed that this was only the first fruit of his long endeavors.
            He plunged into the waves once more–a peal of laughter arose from the sea, and William Falcon was never seen again.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Kaspar went back to the hut, but as a changed man.
            The strange shocks which his weak head and sensitive heart had experienced, wrecked his mind.
            He wandered about, day and night, staring before him in an imbecile way, pitied and yet avoided by all his former acquaintances.
            One stormy night a fisherman claimed to have recognized William Falcon on the shore among the crew of the Carmilhan, and on that same night Kaspar Strumpf disappeared.
            He was sought for every-where, but no trace of him was ever found; but the legend runs that he has often been seen, together with Falcon, among the crew of the spectre ship, which since his loss appears at stated times at the cave of Steenfoll.
