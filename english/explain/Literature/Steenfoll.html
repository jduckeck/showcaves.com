        <h1 class="center">The Cave of Steenfoll</h1>
        <h2 class="center"><b class="smallCaps">William Haufs</b></h2>

        <br class="clear">

        <p>
            On one of Scotland’s rocky islands, there dwelt many years ago, two fishermen, who lived in complete harmony.
            Both were unmarried; neither of them had any relatives living; and their common labor, although differently directed, sufficed to support them both.
            They were of about the same age, but in person and disposition they resembled each other as little as do an eagle and a sea-calf.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Kaspar Strumpf was a short, stout man, with a broad, fat, full-moon face, and good-natured, laughing eyes, to which sorrow and care appeared to be strangers.
            He was not only fat, but sleepy and lazy as well; and therefore the house work, cooking and baking, and repairing of nets for the capture of fish for their own table and for the market, devolved on him, as well as a large part of the cultivation of the small field attached to their cabin.
            Quite the opposite was his companion–tall and lank, with Roman nose and keen eyes; he was known as the most industrious and luckiest fisherman, the most daring cliff-climber after birds and down, the hardest field worker, on the whole island.
            Besides all this, he was considered the keenest trader on the Kirkwall market; but as his wares were good, and his transactions above reproach, every one dealt willingly with him.
            Thus William Falcon and Kaspar Strumpf–with whom the former, avaricious as he was, freely divided his hardly-earned gains–not only made a good living, but were in a fair way of acquiring a certain degree of wealth.
            But a competence would not satisfy Falcon’s covetous soul; he wanted to be rich, extremely rich, and as he had already found out that riches accumulate but slowly in the usual course of industry, he at last settled into the conviction that he should have to attain his riches through some extraordinary stroke of fortune.
            When this idea had once taken possession of his mind, there was no room left for any thing else, and he began to talk this shadowy windfall over with Kaspar Strumpf, as though it had already come to pass.
            Kaspar, who received everything that Falcon said as scripture, repeated all this to his neighbors: and so the report was spread abroad that William Falcon had either sold his soul to the evil one, or had at least received an offer for it from the prince of the infernal regions.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At first, these reports caused much amusement to Falcon; but gradually he began to entertain the notion that a spirit might sometime reveal a treasure to him, and he no longer contradicted his acquaintances when they twitted him on the subject.
            He continued his usual occupations, but with far less zeal than before, and often consumed a great part of the time, that he had formerly passed in fishing or other useful avocations, in idle search for some kind of an adventure by which he should suddenly become rich.
            To still further complete this unfortunate tendency of his mind, it happened that as he was standing one day on the lonely sea-shore, looking out on the restless sea as if he were expecting his good fortune would come from thence, a large wave rolled a yellow ball to his feet amongst a mass of moss and loosened stone–a ball of gold!
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Falcon stood as if bewitched.
            His hopes, then, had not been unsubstantial dreams; the sea had given him gold, beautiful shining gold, the fragment probably of a heavy bar of gold which the sea had rolled on its bottom into the size and shape of a musket ball.
            And now it was clear to his mind that somewhere on this coast there must have been a treasure ship wrecked, and that he had been selected as the chosen one to raise this buried treasure from the sea.
            From this time forth, this search for treasure became the passion of his life.
            He strove to conceal the golden nugget even from his friend, so that others might not discover his purpose.
            He neglected everything else, and spent his days and nights on this coast, not casting his net for fishes, but throwing out a scoop, that he had specially prepared for the purpose, for gold.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But he found poverty instead of wealth; for he earned nothing now himself, and Kaspar’s sleepy efforts would not support them both.
            In the search for the larger mass of gold, not only the nugget was used up, but the entire property of the two men as well.
            But as Strumpf had formerly received the largest part of his living by Falcon’s efforts, taking it all as a matter of course, so now he looked on the profitless undertaking of his friend silently and without a murmur; and it was just this meek forbearance on the part of his friend that spurred Falcon on to continue his restless search for wealth.
            But what made him still more active in his search was, that as often as he laid down to rest and closed his eyes in sleep, a word was sounded in his ear that he seemed to have heard very plainly, and that always appeared to be the same word, and yet he could never recall it.
            To be sure, he did not see what connection this circumstance, singular as it was, might have with his present purpose; but upon a spirit like William Falcon’s everything made an impression, and even this mysterious whisper helped to strengthen his belief that great good luck was in store for him, which he expected to find only in a heap of gold.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            One day he was surprised by a storm on the shore in the same place where he had found the nugget, and he was forced to take refuge from its fury in a cave near by.
            This cave, which the inhabitants called the cave of Steenfoll, consists of a long underground passage opening on the sea, with two entrances, and permitting a free passage of the waves that were continually foaming through them with a loud roar.
            This cave could be entered only from one place–through a fissure from above, that was but seldom approached except by venturesome boys, as in addition to the natural dangers of the spot, the cavern was reported to be haunted.
            Falcon let himself down through this opening with some difficulty, for about twelve feet, and took a seat on a projecting piece of rock beneath an overhanging ledge, where, with the roaring waves beneath his feet and the raging storm above his head, he fell into his usual train of thought about the wrecked ship and what kind of a ship it might have been; for in spite of all his inquiries, he could not obtain any information of a vessel having been wrecked on this spot, even from the oldest
            inhabitants.
            How long he sat thus he did not know himself; but when he finally awoke from his reveries, he found that the storm was over, and he was about to clamber up again, when a voice from out of the depths pronounced the word ” Car-milhan ” very distinctly.
            He climbed up to the top again, and looked down into the abyss once more in great terror.
            “Great Heavens!” exclaimed he, “that is the word that disturbs my sleep! What does it mean?” ” Carmilhan! ” was the sighing response that came once more from the cave; and he fled to his hut like a frightened deer.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Falcon was no coward; his fright was more from surprise than fear; and, more than this, the greed for gold was too powerful in him to allow of his being easily driven from his dangerous path.
            Once, as he was fishing with his scoop for treasure by moonlight, opposite the cave of Steenfoll, his scoop caught on something.
            He pulled with all his strength, but the mass was immovable.
            In the meantime the wind had risen, dark clouds overcast the sky, the boat rocked and threatened to turn over; but Falcon did not lose his presence of mind; he pulled and pulled at his scoop until the resistance ceased, and as he felt no weight he concluded that his rope had broken.
            But just as the clouds were about to obscure the moon’s light, a round, black mass appeared on the surface of the water, and the word that haunted him, ” Carmilhan,” was spoken.
            He made a quick effort to seize the object; but as soon as he stretched out his arm it disappeared in the darkness, and the coming storm forced him to seek protection under the rocks near by.
            Here, overcome by exhaustion, he fell asleep, only to be tormented in dreams by an unbridled imagination, and to suffer anew the pangs experienced in his waking hours, caused by his restless search for wealth.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            When Falcon waked, the first rays of the rising sun fell upon the bosom of the sea, as smooth now as a mirror.
            He was just about to set out on his accustomed work, when he saw something coming towards him from the distance.
            He soon recognized it as a boat.
            Within it sat a human figure; but what aroused his greatest astonishment was that the vessel came on without the aid of sail or oar, and its prow pointed for land without the person sitting in the boat paying any attention to the rudder, if there were one.
            The boat came nearer, and finally stopped near William’s boat.
            Its occupant proved to be a little dried-up old man, dressed in yellow linen, and wearing a red peaked night-cap.
            His eyes were closed, and he sat as motionless as a mummy.
            After vainly shouting at him and jarring the boat.
            Falcon was in the act of making a line fast to the boat to tow it off, when the little man opened his eyes, and began to bestir himself in such a manner as to fill even the bold fisherman’s mind with dread.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Where am I?” asked he in Dutch, after a deep sigh.
            Falcon who had learned something of that language from the Dutch herring-fishermen, told him the name of the island, and inquired who he was and what errand brought him here.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I have come to look for the Carmilhan.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “The Carmilhan ? for Heaven’s sake, what is that?” cried the curious fisherman.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I won’t give an answer to questions addressed to me in such a manner,” replied the little man.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Well then,” shouted Falcon, “what is the Carmilhan ?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “The Carmilhan is nothing now; but once it was a beautiful ship, carrying more gold than ever a vessel carried before.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Where was it wrecked, and when?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “It was a hundred years ago; where, I do not know exactly.
            I come to search for the spot and recover the lost gold; if you will help me we will divide what we find.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “With my whole heart; only tell me what I must do.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “What you will have to do requires courage.
            You must go just before midnight to the wildest and loneliest region on the island, leading a cow, which you must slaughter there, and get some one to wrap you up in the cow’s fresh hide.
            Your companion must then lay you down and leave you alone, and before it strikes one o’clock you will know where the treasures of the Carmilhan lies.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “It was in just such a way that old Engrol was destroyed, body and soul!” cried Falcon, with horror.
            “You are the evil one himself,” continued he as he rowed quickly away.
            “Go back to hell! I won’t have anything to do with you.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The little man gnashed his teeth, and cursed him; but Falcon, who had seized both oars, was soon out of hearing, and on turning round a rocky promontory was out of sight as well.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But the discovery that the evil one was taking advantage of his avarice by seeking to ensnare him with gold, did not open the eyes of the blinded fisherman, but on the contrary he determined to make use of the information the little man had given him, without putting himself in the power of the evil one.
            So while he continued to fish for gold on the desolate coast, he neglected the prosperity offered by large schools of fish off other parts of the coast as well as all other expedients to which he had once turned his attention, and sank with his companion into deeper poverty from day to day, until the common necessaries of life began to fail them.
            But although this ruin might be wholly ascribed to Falcon’s obstinacy and cupidity, and the maintenance of both had fallen on Kaspar Strumpf alone, yet the latter never once reproached his companion, but on the other hand continued to display the same subjection to him, and the same confidence in his superior understanding, as at the time when everyone of his undertakings was successful.
            This circumstance increased Falcon’s sorrows not a little, but drove him into a still keener search for gold, hoping thereby soon to be able to indemnify his companion for so great forbearance.
            The word Carmilhan still haunted him in his sleep.
            In short, need, disappointed hopes, and avarice, drove him finally into a species of insanity, so that he really resolved to do that which the little man had advised–although knowing that, as the legend ran, he thereby gave himself up to the powers of darkness.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Kaspar’s objections were all in vain.
            Falcon became the more determined, the more Kaspar besought him to give up his desperate purpose; and finally the good, weak-minded fellow consented to accompany him and assist him in carrying out his plan.
            The hearts of both men were saddened, as they tied a rope to the horns of a beautiful cow that they had owned since she was a calf, and that was now their last piece of property; they had often refused to sell her before, because they could not bear the thought of letting her go into strange hands.
            But the evil spirit that now controlled Falcon’s actions triumphed over his better nature; nor did Kaspar know how to restrain him in anything.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            It was now September, and the long nights of the Scottish Winter had already begun.
            The night clouds were driven along before the raw night wind, and were banked up in masses like icebergs.
            Deep shadows filled the ravines between the mountains and the peat-bogs, and the troubled channels of the streams appeared black and fearful.
            Falcon led the way and Strumpf followed, shuddering at his own boldness.
            Tears filled Kaspar’s eyes as often as he looked at the poor creature that was going so unconsciously and trustfully to its death, to be dealt it by the hand that had always fed and caressed it.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            With much difficulty they entered a narrow marshy valley, which was here and there strewn with rocks, with patches of moss and heathers, and was shut in by a chain of wild mountains whose outlines were lost in a gray mist, and whose steep sides had seldom been ascended by a human foot.
            They approached a large rock in the centre of the valley over the shaking bog, from which a frightened eagle flew screaming into the sky.
            The poor cow lowed, as if aware of the terrors of the place and the fate that awaited her.
            Kaspar turned aside to wipe away the fast falling tears.
            He looked down to the rocky opening through which they had come, from which point could be heard the breakers on the distant coast, and then up to the mountain peaks, upon which a coal-black cloud had settled, from which might be heard from time to time dull mutterings of thunder.
            As he looked toward Falcon he found that his friend had made the cow fast to the rock, and now stood with uplifted ax in the very act of dealing her death blow.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This was too much for Kaspar.
            Wringing his hands, he fell upon his knees.
            “For God’s sake, William Falcon!” shouted he in despairing tones, “save yourself! Spare the cow! Save yourself and me! Save your soul! Save your life! And if you will persist in tempting God, wait at least until to-morrow and sacrifice some other animal than our own cow!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Kaspar, are you crazy?” shrieked Falcon, like a madman, while he still held the ax swinging in the air.
            “Shall I spare the cow and starve?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “You shall not starve,” answered Kaspar, resolutely.
            “As long as I have hands you shall not suffer hunger.
            I will work for you day and night, so that you do not endanger the peace of your soul, and let the poor creature live for my sake!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Then take the ax and split my head!” shouted Falcon, in desperation.
            “I won’t move from this spot until I have what I desire.
            Can you raise the treasures of the Carmilhan for me? Can your hands earn more than the merest necessaries of life? But you can put an end to my misery.
            Come, and let me be the victim!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “William, kill the cow, kill me! It does not matter to me, I was only anxious about the salvation of your soul.
            Alas! this was the altar of the Picts, and the sacrifice that you would bring belongs to the darkness.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I don’t know anything about that,” cried Falcon, laughing wildly, like one who is resolved not to listen to anything that might swerve him from his purpose.
            “Kaspar, you are crazy and make me crazy, too.
            But there,” continued he, throwing away the ax and picking up his knife from the stone as if about to stab himself; “there, I will kill myself instead of the cow!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Kaspar was at his side in a twinkling, tore the murderous weapon from his hand, seized the ax, poised it high in the air, and brought it down with such a force on the poor cow’s head, that she fell dead at her master’s feet.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A flash of lightning, accompanied by a peal of thunder, followed this rash act, and Falcon stared at his friend in astonishment.
            But Strumpf was disturbed neither by the thunder-clap nor by the fixed stare of his companion; and without speaking a word, fell to work at removing the hide.
            When Falcon had recovered from his amazement, he assisted his companion at this task, but with as evident aversion as he had before manifested eagerness to see the sacrifice completed.
            During their work the thunder-storm had gathered, the thunder reverberated among the mountains, and fearful flashes played about the rock; while the wind roared through the lower valleys and along the coast.
            And when at last the two fishermen had stripped the hide off, they found that they were wet through to the skin.
            They spread the hide out on the ground, and Kaspar wrapped and tied Falcon up in it.
            Then, for the first time, when all this was done, poor Kaspar broke the long silence by saying in a trembling voice, as he looked down at his deluded friend: “Can I do anything more for you, William?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Nothing more,” replied the other; “farewell!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Farewell,” responded Kaspar.
            “God be with you, and pardon you, as I do.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            These were the last words Falcon heard from him, for Kaspar disappeared in the darkness; and immediately thereafter the most terrible thunder-storm occurred that William had ever experienced.
            It began with a flash, that revealed to Falcon’s sight not only the mountains and rocks in his immediate vicinity, but also the valley below, with the foaming sea and the rocky islets in the bay, between which he thought he had a vision of a large foreign ship, dismasted; though the sight was instantly lost again in the inky darkness.
            The thunder-claps were deafening.
            A mass of splintered rock rolled down the mountain-side and threatened to crush him.
            The rain poured down in such torrents that the narrow, marshy valley was flooded with a stream that soon reached to Falcon’s shoulders; fortunately Kaspar had laid him with the upper part of his body on a slight elevation, else he would surely have drowned.
            The water rose still higher, and the more Falcon exerted himself to get out of his dangerous situation, the tighter did the hide seem to wrap itself about his limbs.
            All in vain did he call for Kaspar.
            Kaspar was far away.
            He did not dare to call on God in his distress, and a shudder ran through his frame whenever he thought of appealing for assistance to the powers into whose clutches he was conscious of having delivered himself.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Already the water crept into his ears; now it touched the edge of his lips.
            “Oh, God! I am lost!” screamed he, as he felt the water sweep over his face; but in the same instant the sound of a waterfall close by came dimly to his ears, and his face was immediately uncovered.
            The flood had forced a passage through the stone; and as the rain slackened and the sky grew lighter, so did his despair abate, and a ray of hope returned to his mind.
            But although he felt as exhausted as if just emerged from a death-struggle, and ardently wished to be released from his imprisonment, still the purpose of his desperate efforts was not yet accomplished, and with the vanishing of immediate deadly peril, the demon of greed returned to his breast.
            But, convinced that he must remain in his present situation in order to attain his end, he kept very quiet, and finally, overcome by cold and exhaustion, fell into a sound sleep.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            He might have slept two hours, when a cold wind blowing over his face, and a roaring, as of oncoming waves, aroused him from his happy state of oblivion.
            The sky was darkened anew.
            A flash, like that which had ushered in the first storm, lighted up once more the surrounding region, and he fancied he had another vision of the strange ship, that was now poised for an instant on the crest of an enormous wave close to the Steenfoll cliffs, and then appeared to shoot suddenly into the rocky chasm.
            He continued to stare after the phantom, as the sea was now illuminated by unceasing flashes of lightning, when suddenly a water-spout rose from the valley, near where he lay, and dashed him so violently against a rock as to deprive him of his senses.
            When he recovered consciousness, the weather had cleared, the sky was bright, but the lightning still continued.

            He lay close at the base of the mountains that shut in this valley, feeling so badly bruised that he had no desire to stir.
            He heard the quieter beating of the surf, mingled with a solemn melody like that of a psalm.
            These tones were at first so faint that he thought they must be an illusion; but they occurred again and again, each time clearer and nearer, and at last he thought he could distinguish the melody of a psalm which he had heard on board a Dutch fishing-smack the Summer before.
            Finally he could also make out voices, and he seemed to be able to distinguish the words of the song.
            The voices were now in the valley, and he pushed himself, with difficulty, to a stone, upon which he raised his head, and perceived a procession of human figures, evidently the singers he had heard, and who were coming directly towards him.
            Care and grief were expressed on the faces of these people; and water was dripping from their clothes.
            Now they were close to him, and their song ceased.
            At their head were several musicians; then followed some seamen, and after these came a tall and strong man in a costume richly decorated with gold, apparently belonging to a past age.
            A sword hung at his side, and he carried in his hand a stout Spanish cane with a gold head.
            At his left side walked a negro boy, who, from time to time, handed his master a long-stemmed pipe, from which the latter would take several grave puffs and then walk on.
            He stopped bolt upright before Falcon, while other men, less splendidly dressed, ranged themselves on either side of him.
            They all had pipes in their hands, not, however, as costly as that of their leader.
            Behind them came still other persons, among them being several women, some of whom had children in their arms or at their apron-strings, and all in costly foreign costumes.
            A crowd of Dutch sailors brought up the rear of the procession, each one having a quid of tobacco in his mouth, and holding between his teeth a little cutty-pipe, which he smoked in gloomy silence.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The fisherman shuddered as he looked at this singular assembly; but his expectation that something would come of it all kept his courage up.
            For some time the strange people stood around him thus, and the smoke from their pipes floated over them like a cloud, through which peeped the stars.
            The men closed in on Falcon in an ever-narrowing circle; the smoking became more and more vehement, and the clouds that arose from pipe and mouth increased in density.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Falcon was a bold, daring man; he had prepared himself beforehand for extraordinary occurrences; but when he saw this innumerable crowd pressing in on him as if to crush him by their numbers, his courage failed him, great drops of sweat stood out on his forehead, and he thought he would perish in a spasm of fright.
            But one may imagine his horror when, as he chanced to turn his eyes, he saw, sitting motionless and erect, close by his head, the little old man in the yellow linen suit, looking just as he had the first time except that now, as if making fun of the whole assembly, he, too, had a pipe in his mouth.
            In the mortal fright that now took possession of him, Falcon cried out to the leader of this assembly:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “In the name of whomsoever you serve, who are you? and what do you want with me?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tall man drew three whiffs, even more gravely than before; then gave the pipe to his servant and answered very coldly:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I am Alfred Frank van Swelder, commander of the ship Carmilhan, of Amsterdam, which, on the voyage home from Batavia, went to the bottom with man and mouse on this rocky coast.
            These are my officers, those my passengers, and beyond, my brave crew who were all drowned with me.
            Why have you summoned us from our dwellings deep in the sea? Why do you disturb our rest?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I wish to know where the treasure of the Carmilhan lies.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “On the bottom of the sea.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Where?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “In the cave of Steenfoll.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “How can I recover it?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “A goose dives into the abyss for a herring; is not the treasure of the Carmilhan of as much value?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “How much of it shall I recover?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “More than you will ever spend.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The little man in yellow grinned horribly at this reply, while all the others laughed aloud.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Are you through?” inquired the commander, further.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I am.
            Farewell!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Farewell, until we meet again!” replied the Dutchman, and turned to go; the musicians took the lead again, and the whole procession marched away in the same order in which it had come, and with the same solemn song, which grew ever fainter and fainter in the distance, until finally it was lost in the roar of the breakers.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Falcon now exerted his utmost strength to get out of the hide, and he at last succeeded in freeing one arm, with which he was able to loosen the rope that was wound round him, and soon had stepped out of the hide.
            Without stopping to look about him, he hastened down to his hut, and found poor Kaspar Strumpf lying on the ground in an insensible condition.
            With some difficulty he restored him to consciousness, and the good fellow shed tears of joy on once more beholding the friend of his youth, whom he had given up for lost.
            But this happy consolation vanished quickly, when he learned what a desperate undertaking Falcon now had in mind.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I would rather cast myself into hell than to look any longer at these bare walls and reflect on our misery.
            Follow me, or stay here; I am going at any rate.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            With these words.
            Falcon seized a torch, a tinder-box, and a rope, and hastened away.
            Kaspar ran after him as fast as he could, and found his friend standing on the ledge of the rock upon which he had once sought safety from the storm, and ready to let himself down into the raging abyss.
            When Kaspar found that his entreaties had no effect on the crazed man, he prepared to descend after him; but Falcon ordered him to remain where he was and hold on to the rope.
            With an amount of exertion that could only have been supplied by the blindest of passions, greed, Falcon clambered down into the cave, and at last came to a projecting piece of rock, just below which the black waves, crested with foam, rushed along with a dreadful roar.
            He looked about him eagerly, and finally saw something glistening in the water directly beneath where he stood.
            He laid down his torch, plunged in, and seized a heavy object which he managed to bring back with him.
            It was an iron box filled with gold pieces.
            He shouted up to his companion what he had found; but he would not pay the least attention to Kaspar’s entreaties to content himself with what he had.
            Falcon believed that this was only the first fruit of his long endeavors.
            He plunged into the waves once more–a peal of laughter arose from the sea, and William Falcon was never seen again.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Kaspar went back to the hut, but as a changed man.
            The strange shocks which his weak head and sensitive heart had experienced, wrecked his mind.
            He wandered about, day and night, staring before him in an imbecile way, pitied and yet avoided by all his former acquaintances.
            One stormy night a fisherman claimed to have recognized William Falcon on the shore among the crew of the Carmilhan, and on that same night Kaspar Strumpf disappeared.
            He was sought for every-where, but no trace of him was ever found; but the legend runs that he has often been seen, together with Falcon, among the crew of the spectre ship, which since his loss appears at stated times at the cave of Steenfoll.

        <p class="indentedText">
            “It is long past midnight,” said the student, when the young goldsmith had concluded his story; “there cannot well be any further danger, and I, for my part, am so sleepy that I would advise that we all lay down and go to sleep with a sense of perfect security.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I should not feel safe before two o’clock in the morning,” said the huntsman; “the proverb says, from eleven till two is the thief’s hour.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I am of the same opinion,” observed the compass-maker; “for if they mean us any harm, there is certainly no time so well adapted to their purpose as the small hours.
            Therefore, I think it would be well if the student were to continue his story, which he did not finish.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I will not refuse your request,” responded the student, “although our neighbor, the huntsman, did not hear the beginning of it.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I will try to imagine it, only go on,” replied the huntsman.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Well then,”–the student had just begun, when they were interrupted by the barking of a dog.
            All held their breaths and listened.
            At the same instant one of the servants rushed in from the countess’s room, and announced that from ten to twelve armed men were approaching the inn.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The huntsman seized his rifle, the student his pistol, the journeymen their canes, while the wagoner drew a large knife from his pocket.
            Thus they stood staring at one another helplessly.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Let us station ourselves at the head of the stairs!” cried the student.
            “Two or three of these villains shall meet their death before we are overpowered.” So saying he gave the compass-maker his other pistol, with the understanding that they should fire one after the other.
            They took their places on the stairs–the student and the huntsman first, and near them the courageous compass-maker, who kept his pistol pointed down the centre of the stair-way.
            The goldsmith and the wagoner stood behind them, ready to do their best if it should come to a hand-to-hand fight.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            They had stood thus but a few moments, when the house-door opened, and they heard several voices whispering.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Now they heard the steps of many men nearing the stair-way.
            The steps came up the stairs, and when about half way up three men were made out, who were evidently not prepared for the reception that awaited them.
            As they turned round the pillar that supported the flooring above, the huntsman called out: “Halt! One step further, and you are dead men.
            Cock your guns, friends, and take good aim!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The robbers shrank back; returned hastily to their companions below, and conferred with them.
            After a while one of them came back and said: “Gentlemen, it would be folly in you to sacrifice your lives for nothing; for there are enough of us to completely destroy you; but return to your rooms and not one of you shall be harmed in the least, nor will we take a farthing from you.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “What is your purpose, then?” demanded the student.
            “Do you think we will trust such villains as you? No indeed! If you have any business with us, come on, in God’s name; but the first one who ventures up here I will brand on the forehead so that he will never suffer from headache again!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Surrender the lady to us then,” answered the robber.
            “She shall not suffer harm; we will merely conduct her to a safe place, where she can remain in comfort, while her servants return to the count and inform him that he can ransom her for twenty thousand guldens!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Shall we listen to such propositions?” exclaimed the huntsman, furious with rage as he cocked his gun.
            “I will count three, and if you are not off before I say three, I will pull the trigger! One, two–“
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Hold!” shouted the robber in a tone of command.
            “Is it customary to shoot at an unarmed man, who is holding a friendly parley with you? Foolish fellow, you might shoot me dead, and after all not perform a very heroic deed; but here stand twenty of my comrades who would avenge me.
            How would it benefit your lady countess if you lay dead or stunned on the floor? Believe me, if she will go with us without offering resistance she shall be treated with every consideration, but if you don’t put down your gun before I have counted three, it shall fare hard with her.
            Put down your gun!–One, two, three!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “These dogs are not to be trifled with,” whispered the huntsman to his companion, as he obeyed the robber’s command.
            “Really I am not afraid of my own life, but if I were to shoot down one of them, it might be so much the worse for my lady.
            I will consult with the countess.” Then turning to the robber he continued: “Give us a truce of half an hour in order to prepare the countess.
            It would kill her if she were to be informed of this suddenly.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Granted,” replied the robber, at the same time stationing a guard of six men on the stair-case.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Bewildered and irresolute, the unfortunate travellers followed the huntsman to the countess’s chamber, which was close to the stairs, and so loudly had the men spoken that the lady had not missed a word of what had been said.
            She was pale, and trembled violently, but nevertheless was firmly resolved to accept her fate.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Why should I jeopardize the lives of so many brave men?” said she.
            “Why demand of you, to whom I am a stranger, an idle defence? No; I see no other chance of rescue than to follow these wretches.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            All were impressed by the lady’s spirit and misfortune.
            The huntsman wept, and swore that he could not survive this disgrace.
            The student reviled himself and his stature of six feet.
            “If I were only half a head shorter and had no beard,” said he, “I should know how to act; I would dress myself in the lady countess’s clothes, and these wretches should find out only too late what a blunder they had made.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Felix also had been deeply moved by the lady’s misfortune.
            Her whole presence came so familiarly and affectingly before him, that it seemed to him as if the mother whom he had lost in his youth was now in this terrible situation.
            He would cheerfully have given his life for hers.
            And, as the student spoke, his words awakened an idea in his mind; he forgot all anxiety and every consideration but that of the rescue of this lady.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “If that is all,” said he, stepping forward timidly, and coloring as he spoke, “if only a short stature, a beardless chin, and a courageous heart are needed to rescue this lady, then perhaps I am not unfit for that purpose.
            Put on my coat, gracious lady, hide your beautiful hair beneath my hat, take my bundle on your back and go your way as Felix, the goldsmith.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            All were astonished at the youth’s spirit, while the huntsman fell on his neck in an ecstasy of joy.
            “Goldsmith,” cried he, “you will do that? You will slip into my gracious lady’s clothes and thus save her? The good God has prompted you to do it.
            But you shall not go alone; I will share your captivity, will remain at your side as your best friend, and while I live they shall not harm you.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I too will go with you, as true as I live!” exclaimed the student.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Much persuasion was required before the countess would consent to this scheme.
            She could not bear the thought that a stranger should sacrifice himself for her; she could not help thinking that if the robbers should afterward discover the deception practiced on them, they would take a terrible revenge on the unfortunate youth.
            But finally she was over-persuaded, partly by the entreaties of the young man, and partly by the reflection that if she was saved she would make every exertion to rescue her savior.
            The huntsman and the other travellers accompanied Felix into the student’s room, where he quickly threw on some of the countess’s clothes.
            To still further disguise him, the huntsman secured some locks of the maid’s false hair to the goldsmith’s head, and tied on the lady’s hat.
            All declared that he would never be known; while the compass-maker roundly asserted that if he had met him on the street he should take off his hat without the slightest suspicion that he was bowing to his courageous comrade.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The countess in the meanwhile, with the help of her maid, had dressed herself in the clothes she found in the goldsmith’s knapsack.
            With the hat drawn down over the forehead, the staff in her hand, and the knapsack on her back, she was completely disguised; and the travellers would have laughed not a little at any other time, over this comical masquerade.
            The new travelling journeyman thanked Felix with tears, and promised the speediest assistance.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I have only one request to make,” answered Felix.
            “In the knapsack you have on your back there is a small box; preserve this with the utmost care, for if it should be lost, I should never be happy again.
            I must carry it to my godmother and—-“
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Godfried, the huntsman, knows where my castle is,” interrupted the lady.
            “Every thing shall be given back to you just as it was; for I hope you will come yourself, noble young man, to receive the thanks of my husband and myself.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Before Felix could reply, the harsh voices of the robbers were heard calling from the stairs that the time was up, and that everything was ready for the countess’s journey.
            The huntsman went down to them, and declared that he could not leave the countess, and would rather go with them, wherever they might lead, than to return to his master without his mistress.
            The student also insisted that he should be allowed to accompany the lady.
            The robbers discussed the matter for some time, and finally consented to the arrangement, provided that the huntsman should at once surrender his weapons.
            Then they gave orders that the other travellers should remain perfectly quiet while the countess was being taken away.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Felix pulled down the veil that was spread over his hat, sat down in a corner with one hand supporting his head, and, with the manner of one in deep grief, awaited the robbers.
            The travellers had withdrawn to the other room, but left the door ajar so that they could see all that occurred.
            The huntsman sat down with an appearance of sadness, but keeping a sharp eye on the corner of the room that the countess had occupied.
            After they had sat thus for a few moments, the door opened, and a handsome stately man of about thirty-six years of age entered the room.
            He wore a kind of military uniform, an order on his breast, a long sabre at his side, and in his hand he carried a hat decorated with beautiful feathers.
            Two of his men guarded the door immediately after his entrance.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            He approached Felix with a low bow; he seemed to be somewhat embarrassed in the presence of a lady of rank, as he made several attempts before he was able to speak connectedly.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Gracious lady,” said he, “cases happen now and then in which one must have patience; such an one is yours.
            Do not think that I shall for even a moment lose sight of the respect due to so superior a lady.
            You shall have every comfort, and will have nothing to complain of except perhaps the fright you have suffered this evening.” He paused here, as if awaiting an answer; but as Felix made no reply, he continued: “Do not look upon me as a common thief.
            I am an unfortunate man, whom adverse circumstances have forced into this life.
            We are desirous of leaving this region forever, but need money for that purpose.
            It would have been an easy matter for us to fall upon merchants and stages, but thereby we should have brought lasting misfortune on many people.
            Your husband, the count, inherited half a million thalers not six weeks ago.
            We ask for twenty thousand guldens of this superabundance; certainly a just and moderate demand.
            You will, therefore, have the goodness to write a note to the count at once, informing him that we are holding you for a ransom, that he must send the money as quickly as possible, and that unless he does so–you understand me, we should be compelled to treat you with much less consideration.
            The ransom will not be accepted unless brought by a single man, under a pledge of the strictest secrecy.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This scene was viewed with the most anxious interest by all the guests of the inn, but most anxiously of all by the countess.
            She trembled every moment lest the young man should betray himself.
            She was firmly resolved to ransom him for a large sum, but just as strong was her resolve not to take a single step with these robbers for any earthly consideration.
            She had found a knife in the goldsmith’s coat pocket.
            She held it open in her hand, prepared to kill herself rather than suffer such a fate.
            Not less anxious was Felix himself.
            To be sure, he was consoled and strengthened by the reflection that it was a manly and praiseworthy act to come to the assistance of a helpless lady as he was doing, but he feared lest he should betray himself by each movement or by his voice.
            His alarm increased when the robber spoke of his writing a letter.
            How should he write it? By what title should he address the count? In what style should he write the letter, without betraying himself? But his anxiety rose to the highest pitch, when the robber chief laid paper and pen before him, and requested him to lift his veil and write the letter.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Felix did not know how becoming this disguise was to him, or he would not have entertained the least fear of discovery.
            For, as he finally felt forced to raise his veil, the robber chief, surprised by the beauty of the lady and her somewhat manly and spirited features, regarded her with still greater respect.
            This fact did not escape the young goldsmith’s attention; and satisfied that at least for a moment there was no danger of discovery, he took up the pen and wrote to his pretended husband, after a form that he had once read in an old book:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “My Lord and Husband:–I, unhappy woman, have been seized, on my journey, in the dead of night, by people whom I cannot credit with good intentions.
            They will keep me a prisoner until you, Sir Count, have paid down the sum of twenty thousand guldens for me.
            This is provided you do not inform the authorities of this matter, or seek their assistance; and that you send the money by a single messenger to the forest inn in the Spessart.
            Otherwise I am threatened with a long and severe imprisonment.
            Begging for the speediest deliverance,
            I am your unhappy
            WIFE.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            He handed this remarkable letter to the robber chief, who read it through and signified his approbation.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “It rests with you now to decide,” said he, “whether you will be accompanied by the huntsman or your maid.
            I shall send one of them to your husband with this letter.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “The huntsman, and that gentleman there, will accompany me,” answered Felix.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Very well,” returned the robber, going to the door and summoning the countess’s maid.
            “Just give this woman her instructions.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The maid appeared, shivering and shaking.
            Felix too turned pale when he reflected that here he was in danger once more of betraying himself.
            Still the unexpected courage that had carried him safely through the former ordeal, returned.
            “I have no further commands for you,” said he, “except that you desire the count to take me from this unfortunate situation as quickly as possible.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “And,” added the robber, “that you recommend the count most earnestly and explicitly to keep silent about all this, and not to undertake any action against us, before his wife is in his hands.
            Our spies would give us timely warning of any such demonstrations on his part, and I would not then be answerable for the consequences.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The trembling maid promised to obey these instructions.
            She was further ordered to pack what dresses and linen the lady countess might need in a small bundle, as they could not hamper themselves with much luggage; and when this had been done, the robber chief, with a low bow, requested the lady to follow him.
            Felix stood up, the huntsman and the student followed, and, preceded by the robber, all three descended the stairs.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Before the inn stood a large number of horses.
            One of them was pointed out to the huntsman; another, a beautiful pony provided with a side-saddle, stood ready for the countess; while a third was given to the student.
            The leader lifted the young goldsmith to the saddle, fixed him firmly in his seat, and then mounted a horse himself.
            He rode to the right of the lady, while another of the robbers rode at her left side.
            The student and huntsman were similarly guarded.
            As soon as the band of robbers were mounted, the leader gave a loud and clear whistle as a signal to start, and shortly the whole troop had disappeared in the forest.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The company gathered in the chamber of the inn, gradually recovered from their terror after the departure of the robbers.
            As is generally the case after some great misfortune or sudden danger has passed by, they would have been very cheerful had not their thoughts been occupied with their three companions, who had been led away before their very eyes.
            They all broke out in praise of the young goldsmith, and the countess wept when she reflected how deeply she was indebted to one upon whom she had no claim, whom she had never even known.
            It was a consolation for them all to know that the heroic huntsman and the brave student had accompanied him, and could comfort him in his hours of despondency.
            They even entertained a hope that the experienced forester would discover a means of escape for himself and companions.
            They consulted together as to what they had better do.
            The countess resolved that, as she was bound by no oath to the robbers, she would at once return to her husband, and make every exertion to discover their hiding-place, and set their prisoners free.
            The wagoner promised to go to Aschaffenburg and summon the officials to organize a pursuit of the robbers, while the compass-maker was to continue his journey.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The travellers were not disturbed any more that night; silence reigned in the forest inn, that had an hour before been the theatre of terrible scenes.
            But in the morning, when the servants of the countess went below to prepare for her departure, they came running back, and reported that they had found the landlady and her hostler bound on the floor, and begging for assistance.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The travellers gazed at one another in astonishment.
            “What?” cried the compass-maker.
            “Then these people must have been innocent.
            We have done them wrong, for they can have no association with the robbers.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I will allow myself to be hanged in their place,” returned the wagoner, “if we were not right after all.
            This is only a sham, designed to prevent their conviction.
            Don’t you remember the suspicious appearance of this inn? Don’t you remember how, when I started to go down-stairs, the trained dog would not let me pass? how the landlady and the hostler appeared instantly, and asked in a surly way what I was after? Still, all this was well for us, or at least for the lady countess.
            If things had worn a less suspicious air in the public room, if the landlady had not aroused our distrust, we should not have remained together, nor have kept awake.
            The robbers could have attacked us in our sleep, or at least would have guarded our doors, so that the substitution of the brave young goldsmith for the countess would not have been possible.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            They all agreed with the wagoner, and determined to lodge a complaint against the landlady and her servant, before the magistrate.
            Still, in order to be on the safe side, they concluded not to manifest the least token of suspicion just yet.
            The servants and the wagoner went down-stairs, loosened the bonds of the robbers’ accomplices, and conducted themselves as sympathetically and sorrowfully as possible.
            In order to conciliate her guests still more, the landlady charged each one but a very small amount, and extended them a hearty invitation to call again.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The wagoner paid his reckoning, took leave of his companions in misfortune, and started on his road.
            After him the two journeymen went off.
            Light as the goldsmith’s bundle had been made, it still seemed heavy to the delicate lady.
            But still heavier was her heart, when the traitorous landlady stretched out her hand to take leave of her at the door.
            “Why,” cried she, “what kind of a spark are you, to be going out into the world so young? You must be a spoiled fellow, whom the master chased out of his shop.
            But that’s none of my business; do me the honor to stop here on your return journey.
            Good luck to you!”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The countess was so nervous, and trembled so, that she did not dare reply, least she should be betrayed by her voice.
            The compass-maker, noticing her confusion, took his companion by the arm, bade good-bye to the landlady, and sang a jovial song as they struck out into the forest.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Now I am really in safety,” cried the countess, when they had put a hundred paces between them and the inn.
            “To the last moment I feared that the landlady would recognize me, and have her servant lock me up.
            Oh, how can I thank you for all you have done? Come to my castle; you must at least return to meet your travelling companions again.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The compass-maker consented, and while they were thus speaking, the countess’s carriage came rolling up behind them; the door was quickly opened, the lady sprang inside, waved a farewell to the young journeyman, and was driven rapidly away.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            About this time, the robbers and their prisoners reached the camping place of the band.
            They had ridden over a rough forest road at a fast trot, exchanging not a word with their prisoners, and conversing among themselves in low tones only when they changed their course.
            They finally came to a halt just above a deep ravine.
            The robbers dismounted, and their leader assisted the goldsmith from his horse, apologizing for the fast and wearisome ride he had forced him to take, and inquiring whether the gracious lady felt very much fatigued.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Felix answered him in as gentle a tone as he could assume, that he was in need of rest; and the robber offered his arm to escort him into the ravine.
            The descent was a very steep one, and the footpath was narrow and precipitous.
            At last they were safely down.
            Felix saw before him by the faint light of the opening day, a small narrow valley not more than a hundred paces in circumference, that lay deep in a basin formed by the precipitous rocks.
            Some six or eight small, board and log huts were built in this ravine.
            A few untidy women peeped out curiously from these hovels, and a pack of twelve large dogs and their countless puppies surrounded the new-comers, howling and barking.
            The chief led the countess to the best one of these huts, and told her that this was exclusively for her own use; and granted Felix’s request that the huntsman and the student might be permitted to remain with him.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The hut was furnished with deer-skins and mats, which served at once for a carpet and for seats.
            Some jugs and dishes, made out of wood, a rusty old fowling-piece, and in the further corner a couch made of a couple of boards and a few woollen blankets, which could hardly be dignified by the name of a bed, were the only appointments of the place.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Left alone together for the first time in this miserable hut, the three prisoners had time to think over their strange situation.
            Felix, who did not for a moment repent of his noble action, but who was still nervous as to what would become of him in case of a discovery, gave utterance to loud complaints; but the huntsman quickly checked him, and whispered:
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “For God’s sake, be quiet, dear boy; don’t you know that they will be listening to us.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Each word uttered in such a tone as that would create suspicion in their minds,” added the student.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Nothing remained to poor Felix but to weep silently.
            “Believe me, Mr.
            Huntsman,” said he, “I do not weep for fear of these robbers, or because of this miserable hut; no, it is quite another kind of sorrow that oppresses me.
            How easily might the countess forget what I said to her so hastily, and then I should be considered a thief and thus made miserable forever.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “But what is it, then, that causes you so much anxiety?” inquired the huntsman, wondering at the demeanor of the young man, who, up to this time, had borne himself so courageously.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Listen, and you will do me justice,” answered Felix.
            “My father was a clever goldsmith of Nuremberg, and my mother, previous to her marriage, had served as maid to a lady of rank, and when she married my father she was finely fitted out by the countess whom she had served.
            The countess remained a good friend to my parents, and after my birth she stood as my godmother and made me many presents.
            And when my parents died of a pestilence, and I, left alone in the world, was about to be sent to the poorhouse, this lady godmother heard of my misfortune and placed me in a boarding-school.
            When I was of the proper age, she wrote to know if I would like to learn my father’s trade.
            I jumped at the chance, and she apprenticed me to a master of the art in Wuerzburg.
            I took readily to the work, and had soon made such progress that I was given a certificate, and could set out as a travelling journeyman.
            I wrote this to my lady godmother, and she answered at once that she would give me the money for my outfit.
            With the letter she sent some splendid stones, and requested me to give them a beautiful setting, and bring the ornament to her myself as a proof of my skill, and receive my travelling money at the same time.
            I have never seen my lady godmother, and you may imagine with what pleasure I undertook her commands.
            I worked day and night on the ornament, and turned out such a beautiful and delicate piece of work that even the master was astonished at my skill.
            When it was completed, I packed my knapsack carefully, took leave of my master, and started out on the journey to my lady godmother’s castle.
            Then,” continued he, breaking into tears, “these villainous robbers happened along and destroyed all my hopes.
            For if your lady countess loses the ornament, or forgets what I told her and throws away my old knapsack, how shall I ever face my lady godmother? How should I prove my story? How could I replace the stones? And my travelling money would also be lost, and I should appear as an ungrateful fellow who had foolishly surrendered his charge.
            And, finally, would any one believe me if I were to relate this wonderful adventure?”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Be of good cheer!” replied the huntsman.
            “I do not believe that your ornament can be lost while in the keeping of the countess; and even if such a thing should occur, she would be sure to make the loss good to her deliverer, and would herself bear witness to these mischances.
            We will leave you now for some hours, for we really need sleep, and after the excitement of this night you ought to take some rest.
            Afterwards in conversing with one another let us forget our misfortune for the time being, or, better still, let us think about our escape.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            They went away Felix remained alone, and made an attempt to follow the huntsman’s advice.
            When, after some hours, the student and huntsman returned, they found their young friend in a much better mood.
            The huntsman told the goldsmith that the chief of the band had assured him that the lady should have every attention; and that in a few moments one of the women whom they had seen about the huts would serve the lady countess with coffee, and offer her services as attendant.
            They resolved, in order not to be disturbed, to refuse this favor; and when the ugly old gypsy woman came, set the breakfast before them, and inquired in an obsequious manner whether she could be of any further service, Felix motioned to her to leave, and as she still lingered, the huntsman drove her out of the door.
            The student then narrated all that they had learned about the camp.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “The hut in which you live, beautiful lady countess,” began he, “seems originally to have been designed for the leader of the band.
            It is not so roomy, but it is much finer than the others.
            Beside this, there are six others, in which the women and children live, for there are seldom more than six robbers at home.
            One stands guard not far from this hut; another below him, on the way to the path that leads out of the ravine; and a third stands as sentinel above, at the entrance to the ravine.
            Every second hour they are relieved by the three others.
            More than this, each guard has two large dogs near him, and they are all so wide-awake that one can not set foot outside the hut without being barked at.
            I have no hope that we can steal out of this place.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “Don’t make me sad; I feel more cheerful after my nap,” returned Felix.
            “Don’t give up all hope, and if you fear discovery, let us rather talk about something else, and not be troubled about the future.
            Herr Student, you began a story in the inn; continue it now, for we have time to amuse ourselves.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “I can scarcely remember what it was,” answered the young man.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “You were relating the legend of ‘The Marble Heart,’ and had reached the point where the landlord and the other gambler had put Charcoal Pete out of doors.”
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            “All right; it comes back to me now,” replied he.
            “Well, if you wish to hear more of it, I will continue.” (See story 12)
        </p>
