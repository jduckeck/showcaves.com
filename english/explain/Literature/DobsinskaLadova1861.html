            The Rev Browne must have been a clergyman with a private income to be able to spend so much time visiting the ice caves of Europe.

        <p>
            Martin Bell, the historian of Hungary, sent an account of this cavern toEngland, in the middle of the last century, which was printed in theoriginal Latin in the "Philosophical Transactions of 1739-40" (pp 41 &c.).
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This account states that the cave is in the country of Thorn, (not farfrom Kaschau) among the lower spurs of the Carpathians. The entrance,which faces the north, and is exposed to the cold winds from the snowypart of the Carpathian range, is 18 fathoms<a target="_self" href="#ref2" id="loc2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> high and 9 broad; and thecave spreads out laterally, and descends to a point 50 fathoms below theentrance, where it is 26 fathoms in breath, and of irregular height.
            Beyond this no one had at that time penetrated, on account of the unsafefooting, although many distant echoes were returned by the fartherrecesses of the cave; indeed, to get even so far as this, muchstep-cutting was necessary.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            When the external frost of winter comes on, the account proceeds, theeffect in the cave is the same as if fires had been lighted there: theice melts, and swarms of flies and bats and hares take refuge in theinterior from the severity of the winter. As soon as spring arrives, thewarmth of winter disappears from the interior, water exudes from the roofand is converted into ice, while the more abundant supplies which pourdown on to the sandy floor are speedily frozen there. In the Dog-days,the frost is so intense that a small icicle becomes in one day a hugemass of ice; but a cool day promptly brings a thaw, and the cave islooked upon as a barometer, not merely feeling, but also presaging, thechanges of weather. The people of the neighbourhood, when employed infield-work, arrange their labour so that the mid-day meal may be takennear the cave, when they either ice the water they have brought withthem, or drink the melted ice, which they consider very good for thestomach. It had been calculated that 600 weekly carts would not besufficient to keep the cavern free from ice. The ground above the caveis particuliar'y rich in grass.

            In explanation of these phenomena, Bell threw out the followingsuggestions, which need no comment. The earth being of itself cold anddamp, the external heat of the atmosphere, by partially penetrating intothe ground, drives in this native cold to the inner parts of the earth,and makes the cold there more dense. On the other hand, when theexternal air is cold, it draws forth towards the surface the heat theremay be in the inner part of the earth, and thus makes the caverns warm.
            In support and illustration of this view, he states that in the hotterparts of Hungary, when the people wish to cool their wine, they dig ahole 2 feet deep, and place in it the flagon of wine, and, after fillingup the hole again, light a blazing fire upon the surface, which cools thewine as if the flagon had been laid in ice. He also suggests thatpossibly the cold winds from the Carpathians brings with themimperceptible particles of snow, which reach the water of the cave, andconvert it into ice. Further, the rocks of the Carpathians abound insalts, nitre, alum &c. which may, perhaps, mingle with such snowyparticles, and produce the ordinary effect of the snow and salt in theartificial production of ice.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Townson (Travels in Hungary 1797 pp 317 &c ) visited this cave half acentury later, and concluded that Bell was in error with regard to thesupposed winter thaw and summer frost, although he himself receivedinformation at Kaschau which corroborated the earlier account. Hedescribes the approach to the village of Szilitze as leading by a by-roadthrough a pleasant country of woods and hills, with much pasture-land,the cave lying a mile beyond the village, and displaying an entrance 100feet broad, and 20 or 30 feet high, turned towards the north. Thedescent of the floor of the cave is rapid, and was covered with thin ice,at the time of his visit, for the last third of the way: from the roof atthe farther end, where the cave is not so high as at the entrance, acongeries of icicles was seen to hang: and in a corner on the right,completely sheltered from the rays of the sun, there was a large mass ofthe same material. It was a fine forenoon in July, and all was in astate of thaw, the icicles dropping water, and the floor of ice coveredwith a thin layer of water; while the thermometer in all parts of thecave stood at zero of Réaumur's scale. The rock is compact unstratifiedlimestone, in which so many of the famous caverns of the world arefound.
