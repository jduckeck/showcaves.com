            The Rev Browne must have been a clergyman with a private income to be able to spend so much time visiting the ice caves of Europe.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            Martin Bell, the historian of Hungary, sent an account of this cavern to
            England, in the middle of the last century, which was printed in the
            original Latin in the "Philosophical Transactions of 1739-40" (pp 41 &c.).
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This account states that the cave is in the country of Thorn, (not far
            from Kaschau) among the lower spurs of the Carpathians. The entrance,
            which faces the north, and is exposed to the cold winds from the snowy
            part of the Carpathian range, is 18 fathoms<a target="_self" href="#ref2" id="loc2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> high and 9 broad; and the
            cave spreads out laterally, and descends to a point 50 fathoms below the
            entrance, where it is 26 fathoms in breath, and of irregular height.
            Beyond this no one had at that time penetrated, on account of the unsafe
            footing, although many distant echoes were returned by the farther
            recesses of the cave; indeed, to get even so far as this, much
            step-cutting was necessary.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            When the external frost of winter comes on, the account proceeds, the
            effect in the cave is the same as if fires had been lighted there: the
            ice melts, and swarms of flies and bats and hares take refuge in the
            interior from the severity of the winter. As soon as spring arrives, the
            warmth of winter disappears from the interior, water exudes from the roof
            and is converted into ice, while the more abundant supplies which pour
            down on to the sandy floor are speedily frozen there. In the Dog-days,
            the frost is so intense that a small icicle becomes in one day a huge
            mass of ice; but a cool day promptly brings a thaw, and the cave is
            looked upon as a barometer, not merely feeling, but also presaging, the
            changes of weather. The people of the neighbourhood, when employed in
            field-work, arrange their labour so that the mid-day meal may be taken
            near the cave, when they either ice the water they have brought with
            them, or drink the melted ice, which they consider very good for the
            stomach. It had been calculated that 600 weekly carts would not be
            sufficient to keep the cavern free from ice. The ground above the cave
            is particuliar'y rich in grass.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In explanation of these phenomena, Bell threw out the following
            suggestions, which need no comment. The earth being of itself cold and
            damp, the external heat of the atmosphere, by partially penetrating into
            the ground, drives in this native cold to the inner parts of the earth,
            and makes the cold there more dense. On the other hand, when the
            external air is cold, it draws forth towards the surface the heat there
            may be in the inner part of the earth, and thus makes the caverns warm.
            In support and illustration of this view, he states that in the hotter
            parts of Hungary, when the people wish to cool their wine, they dig a
            hole 2 feet deep, and place in it the flagon of wine, and, after filling
            up the hole again, light a blazing fire upon the surface, which cools the
            wine as if the flagon had been laid in ice. He also suggests that
            possibly the cold winds from the Carpathians brings with them
            imperceptible particles of snow, which reach the water of the cave, and
            convert it into ice. Further, the rocks of the Carpathians abound in
            salts, nitre, alum &c. which may, perhaps, mingle with such snowy
            particles, and produce the ordinary effect of the snow and salt in the
            artificial production of ice.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Townson (Travels in Hungary 1797 pp 317 &c ) visited this cave half a
            century later, and concluded that Bell was in error with regard to the
            supposed winter thaw and summer frost, although he himself received
            information at Kaschau which corroborated the earlier account. He
            describes the approach to the village of Szilitze as leading by a by-road
            through a pleasant country of woods and hills, with much pasture-land,
            the cave lying a mile beyond the village, and displaying an entrance 100
            feet broad, and 20 or 30 feet high, turned towards the north. The
            descent of the floor of the cave is rapid, and was covered with thin ice,
            at the time of his visit, for the last third of the way: from the roof at
            the farther end, where the cave is not so high as at the entrance, a
            congeries of icicles was seen to hang: and in a corner on the right,
            completely sheltered from the rays of the sun, there was a large mass of
            the same material. It was a fine forenoon in July, and all was in a
            state of thaw, the icicles dropping water, and the floor of ice covered
            with a thin layer of water; while the thermometer in all parts of the
            cave stood at zero of Réaumur's scale. The rock is compact unstratified
            limestone, in which so many of the famous caverns of the world are
            found.

                    which is not entirely melted before the commencement of the ensuing

                    masses of ice broken up into a thousand fantastic forms, and presenting
                    by their lucidity a singular contrast to the sombre vaults and massive
                    stalactites of the cavern"
