        <h1 class="center">The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus</h1>
        <h2 class="center">by: <b class="smallCaps">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</b></h2>

        <br class="clear">

        <p class="center">
            IX young men of Caesar's household<br>
            Fled before their master's anger;<br>
            As a god he claimed their worship,<br>
            Though a sorry god was he.<br>
            For an insect, ever buzzing,<br>
            Still annoyed him at the banquet,<br>
            Still disturbed his rest and pleasure.<br>
            All the chasing of his servants<br>
            Could not drive away the torment.<br>
            Ever round the head of Caesar<br>
            Did the angry creature hover,<br>
            Threatening with its poisoned sting<br>
            Still it flew, and swiftly circling,<br>
            Made confusion at the table,<br>
            Messenger of Beelzebub,<br>
            The infernal Lord of flies.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="center">
            "Ha!" -- so spake the youths together,<br>
            "He a god that fears an insect!<br>
            Can a god be thus molested?<br>
            Does a god, like wretched mortals,<br>
            Feast and revel at the banquet?<br>
            Nay! to Him, the one, the only,<br>
            Who the sun and moon created,<br>
            Who hath made the stars in glory,<br>
            Shall we henceforth bend the knee!"
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="center">
            So they spake, and left the palace,<br>
            Left it in their trim apparel;<br>
            By a shepherd led, they hastened<br>
            To a cave was in the mountain,<br>
            And they all went gliding in.<br>
            And the shepherd's dog came after,<br>
            Though they strove to drive him from them;<br>
            Thrust himself toward his master,<br>
            Licked their hands in dumb entreaty,<br>
            That he might remain their fellow;<br>
            And lay down with them to sleep.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="center">
            But the wrath of Caesar kindled,<br>
            When he knew that they had left him;<br>
            All his former love departed,<br>
            All his thought was vengeance only.<br>
            Out in quest he sent his people,<br>
            Traced them to the mountain hollow.<br>
            Not to fire nor sword he doomed them;<br>
            But he bade great stones be lifted<br>
            To the entrance of the cavern;<br>
            Saw it fastened up with mortar;<br>
            And so left them in their tomb.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="center">
            But the youths lay calmly sleeping;<br>
            And the angel, their protector,<br>
            Spake before the throne of glory:<br>
            "I have watched beside the sleepers,<br>
            Made them turn in slumber ever,<br>
            That the damps of yonder cavern,<br>
            Should not cramp their youthful limbs;<br>
            And the rocks around I've opened,<br>
            That the sun at rising, setting,<br>
            May give freshness to their cheeks.<br>
            So they lie in rest and quiet,<br>
            In the bliss of happy dreams."<br>
            So they lay; and still beside them,<br>
            Lay the dog in peaceful slumber,<br>
            Never whimpering in his sleep.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="center">
            Years came on and years departed;<br>
            Till at last the young men wakened;<br>
            And the wall, so strongly fastened,<br>
            Now had fallen into ruin,<br>
            Crumbled by the touch of ages.<br>
            Then Iamblichus, the youngest,<br>
            And the goodliest of them all,<br>
            Seeing that the shepherd trembled,<br>
            Said, "I pray you now, my brothers,<br>
            Let me go to seek provisions;<br>
            I have gold, my life I'll venture,<br>
            Tarry till I bring you bread."
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="center">
            Ephesus, that noble city,<br>
            Then, for many a year, had yielded<br>
            To the faith of the Redeemer,<br>
            Jesus. (Glory to his name!)
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="center">
            And he ran into the city;<br>
            At the gate were many wardens,<br>
            Armed men on tower and turret,<br>
            But he passed them all unchallenged;<br>
            To the nearest baker's went he,<br>
            And in haste demanded bread.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="center">
            "Ha! young rogue," exclaimed the baker,<br>
            "Surely thou hast found a treasure;<br>
            That old piece of gold betrays thee!<br>
            Give me, or I shall denounce thee,<br>
            Half the treasure thou hast found."
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="center">
            And Iamblichus denied it.<br>
            But the baker would not listen;<br>
            Brawling till the watch came forward,<br>
            To the king they both were taken;<br>
            And the monarch, like the baker,<br>
            But a higher right asserting,<br>
            Claimed to share the treasure too.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="center">
            But at last the wondrous story,<br>
            Which the young man told the monarch,<br>
            Proved itself by many tokens<br>
            Lord was he of that same palace,<br>
            Whither he was brought for judgment;<br>
            For he showed them to a pillar,<br>
            In the which a stone was loosened<br>
            Led unto a treasure chamber,<br>
            Heaped with gold and costly jewels.<br>
            Straightway came in haste his kindred,<br>
            All his clan came thronging round him,<br>
            Eager to advance their claim;<br>
            Each was nearer than the other.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="center">
            And Iamblichus, the blooming,<br>
            Young in face, and form, and feature,<br>
            Stood an ancestor among them.<br>
            All bewildered he heard legends<br>
            Of his sons and of his grandsons,<br>
            Fathers of the men before him.<br>
            So amazed he stood and listened,<br>
            Patriarch in his early manhood;<br>
            While the crowd around him gathered,<br>
            Stalwart men, and mighty captains,<br>
            Him, the youngest, to acknowledge<br>
            As the founder of their race!<br>
            And one token with another<br>
            Made assurance doubly certain;<br>
            None can doubt the wondrous story<br>
            Of himself and of his comrades.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="center">
            Shortly, to the cave returning,<br>
            King and people all go with him,<br>
            And they saw him enter in.<br>
            But no more to king or people,<br>
            Did the Chosen reappear.<br>
            For the Seven, who long had tarried --<br>
            Nay, but they were eight in number,<br>
            For the faithful dog was with them --<br>
            Thenceforth from the world were sundered.<br>
            The most blessed Angel Gabriel,<br>
            By the will of God Almighty,<br>
            Walling up the cave for ever,<br>
            Led them unto Paradise.
