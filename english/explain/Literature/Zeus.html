        <h1 align="center">Zeus Grown Up in a Cave</h1>
        <h2 align="center"></h2>

        <br clear="all">

        <p>
            The <b>Titans</b> are a race of godlike giants who were the personifications of
            the forces of nature.
            They are the twelve children (six sons and six daughters) of <b
                class="smallCaps">Gaia</b> (Mother Earth) and <b class="smallCaps">Uranus</b>
            (the god of the sky).
            Each son married (or had children of) one of his sisters.
            Two of them were <b class="smallCaps">Cronus</b> and his wife <b
                class="smallCaps">Rhea</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But Cronus was warned, that one of his children would depose him.
            He knew the consequences, as he had overthrown his father Uranus.
            So he tried to secure his dominion by eating his own children.
            He took them immediately after birth and swallowed them whole, retaining them
            inside his body.
            He ate <b class="smallCaps">Demeter</b>, <b class="smallCaps">Hades</b>, <b
                class="smallCaps">Hera</b>, <b class="smallCaps">Hestia</b>, and <b
                class="smallCaps">Poseidon</b> this way.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Cronus' wife Rhea did not want to loose all her children, and with the help of
            her mother <b class="smallCaps">Gaia</b>, she managed to rescue one son, <b
                class="smallCaps">Zeus</b>.
            She hid him in a cave on Crete and gave <b class="smallCaps">Cronus</b> a stone,
            wrapped in the clothes of the infant, which he swallowed.
            Thus Rhea succeeded in making him believe that he had killed all of his
            children.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Some versions of the legend tell, Zeus was born in the last chamber of this
            cave, and he somtimes has the epithet "the one born on Crete".
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Nymphs <b class="smallCaps">Adrasteia</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Ida</b>
            raised Zeus, feeding him wild honey and milk from the divine goat <b
                class="smallCaps">Amaltheia</b>.
            Adrasteia is an epithet of Rhea Cybele in her attribute of the Mother who
            punishes human injustice, which is a transgression of the natural right order of
            things.
            She is also called <b class="smallCaps">Nemesis</b>.
            Other legends tell, Amaltheia suckled and raised Zeus.
            Some legend say, Amaltheia was a nymph, who nourished Zeus with honey and the
            milk of a goat.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            When Zeus cried, the <b>Kourites</b> (five Cretans) covered his cries by hitting
            their swords against their shields.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            When Zeus reached maturity he overpowered and dethroned his father Cronus and
            made him disgorge his siblings.
            Again there are several versions of the legend.
            Some tell that he compelled his father with the help of Gaia to regurgitate
            them.
            In other version his first wife Metis helped him by giving Cronus an emetic
            potion, which made him vomit up the children.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Zeus led a revolt against his father and the dynasty of the titans, called
            <b>Titanomachy</b>.
            He defeated them in a ten year war and placed them in Tartarus, where they are
            guarded for eternity by the Hecatonchires.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            This tale is part of the Greek mythology and was told many times.
            A important version was written by <b class="smallCaps">Hesiod</b> in his
            <b>Theogony</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave where Zeus was risen, is described as being a cave on Crete, on
            <b>Mount Dicte</b>.
            Two caves in Crete consider as well to be this palce, the <b>Dictean Cave</b>
            near Psichro and the <b>Idaian Cave</b> at Mount Psiloritis.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Very interesting are several deatils of this story.
            All three generations of emperors, <b class="smallCaps">Uranus</b>, <b
                class="smallCaps">Cronos</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Zeus</b> died being killed
            by their own child.
            All three were warned by an oracle that this would happen and all three tried to
            avoid this fate by eating the chirdren (or the mother in the case of <b
                class="smallCaps">Zeus</b>).
            And by doing so they brought their children in rage which lead to their
            destruction.
            The self fulfilling oracle is a rather common motive in Greek mythology.
        </p>
