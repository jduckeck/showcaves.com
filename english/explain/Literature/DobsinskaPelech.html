  <p class="P-P3">In the summer of 1878, when I was on a visit to Hungary, I had the pleasure of seeing the places which this pamphlet describes. I am much indebted to Herrn <span class="S-SmallCaps">Dobay</span>, who rendered me much assistance; and to Herrn <span class="S-SmallCaps">Ruffiny</span>, who conducted me over most of the ground, explaining the chief points of interest. The latter, as the discoverer of the Ice-Cavern, wished that the attention of Englishmen might be directed to it; and at his suggestion I undertook to translate this pamphlet of Dr. <span class="S-SmallCaps">Pelech</span>.</p>

  <p class="P-P3">I have found some difficulty in rendering it into English, owing to the peculiarities of the Hungarian style of composition; and though on the whole I have given a very literal translation, I have considered it advisable in certain cases to deviate from the original.</p>

  <p class="P-P3">My thanks are due to the following gentlemen:&mdash;To Dr. <span class="S-SmallCaps">Pelech</span> for the use of the copyright of his pamphlet; to Dr. <span class="S-SmallCaps">Klein</span> for the use of his translation, from which this version is compiled; to Dr. <span class="S-SmallCaps">Alexander Joseph Krenner</span>, from whose work on the cavern, the section, ground plan, and some of the notes are borrowed; to Herren <span class="S-SmallCaps">Döller</span> and <span class="S-SmallCaps">Ruffiny</span> for obtaining permission (the former from the Karpathen-Verein, and the latter from the respective authors) for me to use the above-mentioned works.</p>

  <p class="P-P3">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P3"><span class="S-T">The county of</span> <span class="S-T1">Gömör</span> <span class="S-T">has become famed owing to the extreme variety as well as to the grand proportions of its natural beauties. In the southern part, grapes flourish well, excellent tobacco and dainty melons thrive, and the wheat is not inferior to that of</span> <span class="S-T1">Banat</span><span class="S-T">; while on the highest peaks of its northern portion, corresponding to different climatic and geological relations, even brushwood and the unadorned mosses and lichens of the "</span><span class="S-T2">Hola"</span> <span class="S-T">can barely manage to exist. And while again upon us who live in the plain between</span> <span class="S-T1">Tornallya</span> <span class="S-T">and</span> <span class="S-T1">Putnok</span><span class="S-T">, there are wafted the gentle breezes of the South Hungarian lowlands, awakening in us the pastoral poetry of the &nbsp;</span><span class="S-T1">Puszta</span><span class="S-T">, in the district north of</span> <span class="S-T1">Dobschau</span><span class="S-T">, along the</span> <span class="S-T1">Graner Thal</span><span class="S-T">, we may delight our eyes with wild, romantic, shadowy Swiss landscapes. If one may reckon as so many treasures of</span> <span class="S-T1">Gömör</span> <span class="S-T">the pleasant vales of</span> <span class="S-T1">Saj&oacute;</span><span class="S-T">,</span> <span class="S-T1">Csetnek</span><span class="S-T">, and</span> <span class="S-T1">Jolsva</span><span class="S-T">, with their varied rural loveliness, the "Hot Springs" of</span> <span class="S-T1">Tornallya</span><span class="S-T">, the world-renowned stalactite caves of</span> <span class="S-T1">Aggtelek</span><span class="S-T">&mdash;then not the least valuable pearls of this treasury are the romantic oft-admired</span> <span class="S-T1">Stracenaer Thal</span><span class="S-T">, and especially that marvelous freak of Nature, the</span> <span class="S-T1">Dobschau ice-cavern</span><span class="S-T">. The valley of</span> <span class="S-T1">Stracena</span> <span class="S-T">and the ice-cavern leave upon all visitors a lasting impression: their every feature is so attractive that from whatever side regarded they appear worthy of investigation; even the description of them must appeal to us, provided the representation be a faithful one. To give such information is the task I now propose to undertake.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P3">If the kind reader will accompany me, I will be his guide through the <span class="S-T1">Stracenaer Thal</span>; I will direct his attention to the most interesting points, we will go down into the wonderful labyrinth of the ice-cavern, we will contemplate it with all its marvelous appearances&mdash;and he will allow that I, though a physician by profession, can for once be, not a disciple of <span class="S-T3">&AElig;</span>sculapius, but a priest of Nature herself.</p>

  <p class="P-P3"><span class="S-T">The</span> <span class="S-T1">Stracenaer Thal</span> <span class="S-T">or</span> <span class="S-T1">Grosse Eng</span><span class="S-T">, about 6 miles to the N.W. of</span> <span class="S-T1">Dobschau</span><span class="S-T">, is situated on the parallel of 48&deg; 51' N. lat., and between the meridians of 20&deg; 15' 9" and 20&deg; 23' 9" E. longitude. If at the inn with the sign "</span><span class="S-T1">Zu den 3 Rosen"</span> <span class="S-T">the traveler strike the road which leads from</span> <span class="S-T1">Dobschau</span> <span class="S-T">up the</span> <span class="S-T1">Langenberg</span><span class="S-T">, he immediately begins to ascend a slope covered with shrubs, underwood, enclosed plots, and flowery meadows. Here he comes across sandstone and slate of the Triassic and Carboniferous periods, and also Gabbro alternating with layers of mica-schist: on the same slope he sees on his left a cart-road leading to the famous nickel and cobalt mines of the</span> <span class="S-T1">Zemberg</span><span class="S-T">, which yield a yearly average of 2000 Zoll-Zentner of cobalt ore; while on the right hand he may view with astonishment vast ironstone quarries. As soon as the summit (</span><span class="S-T1">Das Kreuz</span><span class="S-T">) of the</span> <span class="S-T1">Langenberg</span> <span class="S-T">is reached (1,000 m.), we are taken aback and fastened to the spot by a splendid panorama. In the narrow valley at our feet lies the town of</span> <span class="S-T1">Dobschau</span><span class="S-T">; to the south we catch sight of the mountain</span> <span class="S-T1">Rhadzim</span> <span class="S-T">in all its grandeur; and the outlines of the mountains gradually losing their sharpness melt away in the flatter heights towards</span> <span class="S-T1">Rosenau</span><span class="S-T">, producing with the warm violet tints of the horizon a fine effect in the fading blue of perspective. To the north opens out a Swiss landscape; at our feet lies a moderately broad valley, the</span> <span class="S-T1">Göllnitz Thal</span><span class="S-T">, opposite to us the whole slope which bounds this valley is overgrown on its steeper parts with gigantic pines; whilst here and there the fantastic peaks of</span> <span class="S-T">grey</span> <span class="S-T">limestone stretch boldly heavenwards. At the foot of the mountain shimmers the crystal water of a tarn; no ripple stirs its mirror, sublime in its tranquility, reflecting the pines with their fresh green foliage, which have occupied the cliff for a hundred years. Between the peaks appears the</span> <span class="S-T1">Gerava</span><span class="S-T">, where are the ironworks of</span> <span class="S-T1">Palzmann</span><span class="S-T">, sending up wreaths of smoke and myriads of sparks; the</span> <span class="S-T1">Göllnitz</span><span class="S-T">stream, like a silver ribbon, traverses the valley, its water plentifully stocked with the prettiest of fish, the trout; the hamlets of</span> <span class="S-T1">Ist</span><span class="S-T4">&acirc;</span><span class="S-T1">nfalva</span> <span class="S-T">and</span> <span class="S-T1">Imrichfalva</span><span class="S-T">, and the blast furnace of</span> <span class="S-T1">Dobschau</span><span class="S-T">, are picturesquely situated higher up.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P3"><span class="S-T">Near the "</span><span class="S-T1">Kreuz</span><span class="S-T">" the road in front descends to the Palzmann-shütte and that to the left towards</span> <span class="S-T1">Stracena</span><span class="S-T">: we choose the latter. Our path now leads us through a pine forest, and we soon enter a narrow valley which might very properly be called "</span><span class="S-T5">The Pass,"</span> <span class="S-T">for it is so narrow as to allow just room for the high road, with a small stream three to four metres wide occupying the bottom of the gorge; its sides are formed on the right by the steep slopes of</span> <span class="S-T2">the Stein</span><span class="S-T">, on the left by the southern slope of the</span> <span class="S-T1">Pelz-Gebirge</span><span class="S-T">, covered with dense pine forests.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P1"><span class="S-T">Immediately on reaching this valley we find by the roadside a number of funnel-shaped hollows with a diameter of ten to twenty metres, styled</span> <span class="S-T6">by</span> <span class="S-SmallCaps1">Krenner</span> <span class="S-T6">"</span><span class="S-T5">Dolinen";</span> <span class="S-T">this word, however, is not quite appropriate, for</span> <span class="S-T2">Dolina</span> <span class="S-T">is a Slavish word signifying Dale, hence it would be better to employ the term "crater" according to</span> <span class="S-SmallCaps">Hunfalvy</span><span class="S-T">, (The Hungarian word</span> <span class="S-T2">töbör</span> <span class="S-T">= crateriform depression.) Similar craters are to be found in all places where water containing carbonic acid gas, dropping on limestone, dissolves out the lime and hollows out the rocks; the consequence of which is that the earth covering in the hollow space loses its hold and falls in, thus forming the crater. Many such craters are found on the mountains around</span> <span class="S-T1">Stracena</span><span class="S-T">, in the neighborhood of the ice-cavern; also in several localities in the county of</span> <span class="S-T1">Gömör</span><span class="S-T">: at the</span> <span class="S-T1">Aggteleker cavern</span> <span class="S-T">especially are an enormous number of them, the people there calling them "</span><span class="S-T2">Ravaszlyuk"</span> <span class="S-T">(false, treacherous holes).</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P3"><span class="S-T">Our vale is a quiet contemplative spot, whose constraining stillness is alone broken by the babbling water of a little brook. But, strange phenomenon, as we pass down the stream, its murmur seems to lose strength, the volume of the water to diminish more and more, till at last the brook has utterly vanished. There is no deception, it is a fact; the earth has swallowed it up. Lower down in the valley, however, it reappears, and finally joins the waters of the</span> <span class="S-T1">Göllnitz</span><span class="S-T">. This little brook bears the name "Floren-seufen" (Verloren-seufen) and the whole valley is called after it, or known simply by the name</span> <span class="S-T1">Graben</span><span class="S-T">: the</span> <span class="S-T1">Stracenaer Thal</span> <span class="S-T">also derives its name from the vanished stream (Slavish, "straceny"&mdash;"vanished"). A similar stream which becomes thus suddenly dried up, but soon wells out again to the surface, may be found on the</span> <span class="S-T1">Hanneshöh</span> <span class="S-T">mountain in the district of the town</span> <span class="S-T1">Dobschau</span><span class="S-T">.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P3">Pursuing our way for a short distance we come into the <span class="S-T1">Göllnitz Thal</span>, whose descent is from left to right; the higher or left (W) portion of this is the valley of <span class="S-T1">Stracena</span>.</p>

  <p class="P-P3">Its leading features are&mdash;its direction from west to east, the many sharp curves, its resemblance to a defile every here and there becoming broader, the picturesque rock-groups and the steep wooded slopes, the crystal clearness of the stream, the well-made and costly road, with its frequent bridges over the <span class="S-T1">Göllnitz</span>. These, with the varied blending of form and color, and the splendid harmony of their picturesque gradations, give to the whole valley an impressive aspect of wild romance. At the entrance to the valley, close to the opening into the <span class="S-T1">Graben</span>, lies the little hamlet of <span class="S-T1">Stracena</span>, consisting of about fifty scattered houses built chiefly of wood: its inhabitants, Roman Catholic by religion, are all Slavs, and are occupied in hewing wood and in working at the blast furnaces of Duke August <span class="S-T1">Coburg</span>, who has extensive ironworks here. The average yearly produce of pig-iron is 100,000 Zoll-Zentner, and 100 men are constantly employed; the quantity of ironstone necessary to furnish the above weight of iron is 250,000 Zoll-Zentner, requiring a consumption of a million cubic feet of charcoal.</p>

  <p class="P-P3"><span class="S-T">The neat residences of the managers surround the works. As soon as we have left the hamlet, the valley, with its characteristic peculiarities, lies before us. At the very entrance rises</span> <span class="S-T">up on our left (</span><span class="S-T2">i.e.</span> <span class="S-T">on the right bank of the</span> <span class="S-T1">Göllnitz</span><span class="S-T">) the</span> <span class="S-T1">Hanneshöh</span> <span class="S-T">with its pine-covered</span> <span class="S-T">slopes; on our right is the</span> <span class="S-T1">Macsk&aacute;shegy</span> <span class="S-T">(Cat's Crag). The tourist who traverses this dale, be he ever so unsociable a man of figures, a cold calculator, a hero of hard realities, who, wrapped up in himself, can take no pleasure in life, loving to sweep away with a rude hand its poetry and its dewy pearls&mdash;be he ever so sworn a foe to useless dreaming, to idle fancy&mdash;yet will he in spite of himself be transported into a poetical mood, spell-bound by a sense of Nature's beauty; rapidly does his self-sufficiency give place to a feeling of helplessness when confronted by her giant power and grandeur, and there comes upon him a consciousness of his lowness and littleness, still unwittingly he feels with</span> <span class="S-SmallCaps">Shakespeare</span> <span class="S-T">&mdash;</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P">"As flies to wanton boys, are we to the Gods,</p>

  <p class="P-P">They kill as for their sport."</p>

  <p class="P-P3">This valley is for the most part so narrow that there is only space enough for the well-kept road and the river <span class="S-T1">Göllnitz</span>, here 8 to twelve metres broad; the former winds about, now skirting the right, now the left slope of the hill: in the valley of <span class="S-T1">Stracena</span> alone it crosses the meandering stream by thirteen bridges, partly of wood and partly of stone. The <span class="S-T1">Göllnitz</span> rises on the east flank of the <span class="S-T1">Königsberg</span> to the north of the village of <span class="S-T1">Talg&aacute;rt</span>, and flows into the <span class="S-T1">Hern&aacute;d</span>, near <span class="S-T1">Margitfalva</span>. Here and there the valley suddenly spreads out into a flat, adorned with grass and thousands of wild flowers; soon again it contracts,. and its pine-clad slopes almost touch one another. What a wonderful harmony between the thick projecting pine-woods and the high rocky summits! Stern, still, and motionless as the cliff, with the stately dignity of rigid repose, stands the array of tree tops like a host armed with lances; the deep silence is broken only by the twitter of a bird, and the monotonous murmur of the river flowing through the valley; a soft bed of moss covers the ground, and thousands of Alpine plants with their fresh green form a picturesquely variegated carpet. The air is extremely pure, transparent, and filled with the fragrant odor of the pine, so refreshing and delicious that merely to inhale it is a positive luxury. A moment afterwards an entirely new picture meets our gaze: the pine-clad slope is replaced by a grey-coloured mass of rock, whose monotony is relieved by no trace of verdure. Wild peaks point proudly heavenwards, all around are zigzag furrowed ridges with their bold projecting crags, and smooth walls of rock drop now and then like immense curtains. Here is seen a pyramidal mass and there a tall column, and the intervals are occupied by loose rocky fragments, which every moment threaten to come rushing downwards. To the narrow ledges of rock cling solitary stout pines, their entangled roots sometimes peering out like a grey serpent from the moss-covered scanty soil, while with their prickly branches and tapering points they stand out sharply defined against the blue sky: the mossy mat drooping from the crevices hangs in picturesque festoons of tangled roots and climbing plants.</p>

  <p class="P-P3">If we did not know that <span class="S-SmallCaps">Schiller</span>'s bold fancy had suggested the celebrated "<span class="S-T2">Spaziergang"</span> to Kirchner's pencil, we might well believe we had found the original among these cliffs.</p>

  <p class="P-P3">A new picture strikes the eye at every turn; the stream alone, with its crystal waters, follows us everywhere; the long narrow valley is filled with that siren's song, produced by its murmuring, rushing, and splashing. Now it is roused by a sudden fall, where it dashes over heaps of boulders; now perpendicular banks hem it in on either side; but with all the greater impetuosity it rushes onwards, and beats violently against their green walls covered with algae. Now its purling waters are scattered into thousands of tiny drops of spray, sporting with rainbow tints in the sunshine; now it whirls round in a vortex, and again its clatter subsides into a gentle murmur as it glides over a fine sandy bed, or floats above the polished slabs of rock, like a veil of transparent enamel: and where in sublime stillness it fills the deeper recesses, the dark grey crags and motionless pines mirror themselves upon its surface like silent witnesses&mdash;presenting a magic harmony of deathlike silence and repose with the restlessness of living motion. We occasionally come on a meadow of soft green grass, with contented sheep browsing. Perdita in the "Winter's Tale," or Dorcas and Mopsa, could find no prettier spot for feeding their flocks.</p>

  <p class="P-P3"><span class="S-T">But to return to the road that we have left. Close by the churchyard of the village of</span> <span class="S-T1">Stracena</span><span class="S-T">, on the slopes of the</span> <span class="S-T1">Macskashegy</span> <span class="S-T">(Cat's Crag), is a defile, called the</span> <span class="S-T1">Falkengrepp</span><span class="S-T">, hemmed in by walls of rock on either side. When we have advanced a few hundred paces the gorge seems to have become a prison. On both sides of us perpendicular rocks rise in tiers one above the other, forming a narrow amphitheatre; mighty pyramids, fissured towers, craggy peaks, stretch upwards as if to pierce the vault of heaven; yonder is a motionless cataract of stone, a collection of boulders, which a slight thrust from above would send rolling down to the bottom with a deafening roar. Yet the scene is not entirely desolate, for the slopes are here and there decked with groups of pine trees. If we quit this stone-world and follow for about half an hour a steep narrow footpath, meandering upwards among confused fragments of rock, we reach a broad plateau&mdash;a mountain meadow rich with flowers&mdash;where we rest a while to enjoy the splendid view before starting again on our journey. Our path brings us to the</span> <span class="S-T1">Reibenstein</span><span class="S-T">, 1158 metres above sea-level. This point is noted for its magnificent panorama of the neighboring mountain peaks as far as</span> <span class="S-T1">Zipsen</span><span class="S-T">, as well as of the imposing</span> <span class="S-T1">Tatra mountains</span><span class="S-T">, which with their lofty pyramidal slopes and snow-clad summits projected against the warm purple-blue sky tints present a grand picture: but still more is it celebrated for the "</span><span class="S-T2">Intermittent Spring,"</span> <span class="S-T">known as the</span> <span class="S-T1">Stracenaer Quelle</span><span class="S-T">, situated close by, a little lower down the mountain side. This is a spring which at intervals ceases to flow, quickly, however, to issue forth again. At the mouth of the spring its basin presents the form of a depression 60 cm. deep and 50 cm. wide, partially filled with fragments of limestone. From its edge there extends downwards a tolerably large channel, which gradually widens into a broad conduit; the bed of the outflowing stream is similarly covered with calcareous d&eacute;bris. The basin-shaped cavity of the spring is dry, but clear water soon issues forth from between the pebbles, increases in quantity, and, after a few minutes, a swift current of water flows out from the depths below, and hastens along the dry channel; generally, in about half an hour it subsides, and after a lapse of from two to three hours well up again. In dry seasons this pause is of longer duration, the water issuing forth only at intervals of from two to three days; in any case, however, the volume of the water and the duration of its flow are always the same.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P3"><span class="S-T">This phenomenon is to be explained on the principle of the syphon. A rather large space must exist in the interior of the mountain, situated, however, at a higher level than the mouth of the spring; this is contracted into a narrow channel, which extends upwards to a certain height and then takes a bend downwards, and so reaches the surface. The inner chamber is filled either from a special smaller reservoir, or by water that drains through the rocks from the surface. As soon as the channel is filled up to its highest point the water flows out into the basin and so comes to the surface, the whole mass of water in this system of channels and in the inner cavity becoming emptied, on the principle of the syphon. The spring is about 930 metres above sea-level. The</span> <span class="S-T1">Rabenstein</span> <span class="S-T">and the Intermittent Spring are points much frequented by members of learned societies, as well as by individual tourists. Formerly a mill-wheel was erected at the mouth of the spring in such a manner that, caused to rotate by the outflowing of the water, it gave a rhythmical motion to a small hammer, which then struck smartly a resounding plate. This served as an indicator to any pleasure parties who were amusing themselves in the neighborhood of the spring that the water was beginning to flow. In fact, the tale goes that the striking of the</span> <span class="S-T">hammer was well known to the deer, which often at this signal came to the spring to quench their thirst.</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P3"><span class="S-T">We will, however, retrace our steps, and continue on our course. Opposite the</span> <span class="S-T1">Falkengrepp</span><span class="S-T">, but a little further up the valley, a miniature dell,</span> <span class="S-T1">die kleine Eng</span><span class="S-T">, penetrates the</span> <span class="S-T1">Hanneshöh</span><span class="S-T">; through it flows a pretty rivulet, which at intervals is lost to sight, resembling the one we have already described in the</span> <span class="S-T1">Graben</span><span class="S-T">. At the entrance of the ravine is a small village named</span> <span class="S-T1">Spital</span><span class="S-T">, inhabited by woodcutters and charcoal burners. From this point the valley widens out considerably, and our road leads across the level surface direct to a tongue of rock that projects obliquely across the valley as far as the water's edge. On it repose mighty blocks of stone like pyramids, and at intervals firs shoot up, securely grasping with their roots the jutting crags. Not until we have reached this wall of rock do we perceive that a tunnel has been excavated, through which we can easily drive in our carriage. This is the</span> <span class="S-T1">Stracenaer Felsentor</span><span class="S-T">, or</span> <span class="S-T1">Rock Gate</span> <span class="S-T">(Plate I.) In the arch of this gate is fixed a tablet with the inscription</span> <span class="S-T1">"A'goston, Sz&aacute;sz-Coburg-G&oacute;thai herczeg, a magyar term&eacute;szettudom&aacute;nyi t&aacute;rsulat elnöke, t&eacute;ged e szikl&aacute;k dics&eacute;rnek."</span> <span class="S-T">("Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, President of the Hungarian Natural History Society, these rocks proclaim thy renown.")</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P">Szikla-Kapu &ndash; The Rock Gate</p>

  <p class="P-P3">Having driven through this gate, we find ourselves in a narrower part of the valley, and our road winds about, following its bends, now to the right and now to the left, constantly changing its direction.</p>

  <p class="P-P3">Not far from the gate our attention is attracted by a group of rocks situated on the right bank of the river. Close bordering upon the road there rises abruptly a smooth and lofty cliff, looking like the wall of a fortress, from 8o to 90 metres in height. Close to it is a second, and behind that again a third. They present several yawning fissures, and have the appearance of a ruined rampart; the summits of one, the ridges of another, are shattered into fragments; this, like a bastion, proudly raises its head aloft, and that, like a ruined tower, totters on the verge of destruction. This is the <span class="S-T1">Stracenaer Felsenburg</span>.</p>

  <p class="P-P3"><span class="S-T">On proceeding further solid rock masses impede our way, as at the</span> <span class="S-T1">Felsentor</span><span class="S-T">, and we drive through a cutting bordered on either side by huge walls of stone. The inscription, "Ferdinand Coburg, 1840," here carved on the rock, bears witness to the genius by which his Highness the Duke opened up this way for traffic, thereby bringing the iron industry to the height of prosperity. This is termed the "</span><span class="S-T2">Einschnitt,"</span> <span class="S-T">or "</span><span class="S-T2">Cutting."</span>&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="P-P3"><span class="S-T">At this point the mountain</span> <span class="S-T1">Krivan</span><span class="S-T">, covered with dense pine-woods, towers above the right bank of the stream, while on the left is the mountain range known as the</span> <span class="S-T1">Rehfelder Gebirgsreihe</span><span class="S-T">. We soon reach another interesting point. The valley, after a sharp turning, spreads out into a level plain, while our road ascends to a considerable height above this, skirting the edge of the</span> <span class="S-T1">Krivan</span><span class="S
