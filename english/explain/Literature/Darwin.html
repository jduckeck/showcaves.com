        <h2>Effects of Use and Disuse</h2>

        <p>
            It is well known that several animals, belonging to the most different
            classes, which inhabit the caves of Styria and of Kentucky, are blind. In
            some of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains, though the eye is
            gone; the stand for the telescope is there, though the telescope with its
            glasses has been lost. As it is difficult to imagine that eyes, though
            useless, could be in any way injurious to animals living in darkness, I
            attribute their loss wholly to disuse. In one of the blind animals,
            namely, the cave-rat, the eyes are of immense size; and Professor Silliman
            thought that it regained, after living some days in the light, some slight
            power of vision. In the same manner as in Madeira the wings of some of the
            insects have been enlarged, and the wings of others have been reduced by
            natural selection aided by use and disuse, so in the case of the cave-rat
            natural selection seems to have struggled with the loss of light and to
            have increased the size of the eyes; whereas with all the other inhabitants
            of the caves, disuse by itself seems to have done its work.

            It is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep
            limestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that on the common
            view of the blind animals having been separately created for the American
            and European caverns, close similarity in their organisation and affinities
            might have been expected; but, as Schiodte and others have remarked, this
            is not the case, and the cave-insects of the two continents are not more
            closely allied than might have been anticipated from the general
            resemblance of the other inhabitants of North America and Europe. On my
            view we must suppose that American animals, having ordinary powers of
            vision, slowly migrated by successive generations from the outer world into
            the deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky caves, as did European
            animals into the caves of Europe. We have some evidence of this gradation
            of habit; for, as Schiodte remarks, 'animals not far remote from ordinary
            forms, prepare the transition from light to darkness. Next follow those
            that are constructed for twilight; and, last of all, those destined for
            total darkness.' By the time that an animal had reached, after numberless
            generations, the deepest recesses, disuse will on this view have more or
            less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and natural selection will often have
            effected other changes, such as an increase in the length of the antennae
            or palpi, as a compensation for blindness. Notwithstanding such
            modifications, we might expect still to see in the cave-animals of America,
            affinities to the other inhabitants of that continent, and in those of
            Europe, to the inhabitants of the European continent. And this is the case
            with some of the American cave-animals, as I hear from Professor Dana; and
            some of the European cave-insects are very closely allied to those of the
            surrounding country. It would be most difficult to give any rational
            explanation of the affinities of the blind cave-animals to the other
            inhabitants of the two continents on the ordinary view of their independent
            creation. That several of the inhabitants of the caves of the Old and New
            Worlds should be closely related, we might expect from the well-known
            relationship of most of their other productions. Far from feeling any
            surprise that some of the cave-animals should be very anomalous, as Agassiz
            has remarked in regard to the blind fish, the Amblyopsis, and as is the
            case with the blind Proteus with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am
            only surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved,
            owing to the less severe competition to which the inhabitants of these dark
            abodes will probably have been exposed.
