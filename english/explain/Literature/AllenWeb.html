            the Central American region of the Western Continent are
            found the ruins of what are pronounced by all scholars to be the
            highest civilization, and the most ancient in time, of any in
            the New World. There it arose, flourished, and tottered to its
            fall. Its glory had departed, its cities were a desolation,
            before the coming of the Spaniards. The explorer who would visit
            them finds himself confronted with very great difficulties.
            Their location is in a section of the country away from the
            beaten track of travel. Their sites are overspread with the
            luxuriant vegetation of tropical lands, through which the
            Indian's machete must carve a passage. The states in which they
            are situated are notorious for anarchy and misrule, and the
            climate is such that it is dangerous for those not acclimated to
            venture thither during a large part of the year. So it is not
            strange that but few have wandered among these ruins, and
            described them to the world at large.

            But the accounts thus presented are interesting in the extreme,
            though they have raised many questions that have thus far defied
            solution. There is no doubt but what there exist large groups of
            ruins not yet described, structures and monuments which might,
            perhaps, throw some light on a past that now seems hopelessly
            lost. But the ruins thus far described are so numerous, their
            similarity is so evident, that we feel we have but little to
            hope from such undiscovered ruins. There are, doubtless, richly
            ornamented facades, grotesquely sculptured statues, and
            hieroglyphic-covered altars, but they would prove as much of an
            enigma as those already known. Our only hope is that some
            fortunate scholar will yet discover a key by whose aid the
            hieroglyphics now known may be read. Then, but not until then,
            will the darkness that now enshrouds ancient Maya civilization
            be dissipated.

            As will be seen from a glance at the map, the most important
            ruins are in the modern states of Honduras, Guatemala, Chiapas,
            and especially Yucatan, the northern portion of this peninsula
            being literally studded with them. The river Usumacinta and its
            numerous tributaries flowing in a northern direction through
            Chiapas is regarded as the original home of the civilization
            whose ruins we are now to describe. From whence the tribes came
            that first settled in this valley is as yet an unsettled point.
            We notice that we have here another instance of the influence
            that fertile river valleys exert upon tribes settling therein.
            The stories told us of the civilization that flourished in
            primitive times in the valleys of the Euphrates and the Nile are
            not more wonderful--the ruins perhaps not more impressive--than
            are the traditions still extant, or the material remains fallen
            in picturesque ruins, of the civilization that once on a time
            held sway in the Usumacinta Valley.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            One of the most famous groups of ruins in this section of the
            country is that of Copan, situated in Honduras, but very near
            the Guatemala line. This is commonly spoken of as "the oldest
            city in America,"
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='Bancroft: "Native Races," Vol. V, p. 78.'>[1]</a>
            and has some evidence to substantiate this
            claim. Whatever be its relative antiquity, it is doubtless very
            old, as it was probably in ruins at the time of the conquest.
            There are several facts going to prove this assertion.
            When Cortez, in 1524, made his march to Honduras, he passed
            within a few leagues of this place. He makes no mention of it,
            which he would have been very apt to do had it been inhabited.
            Fifty years later Garcia De Palacio made a report on these ruins
            to the king of Spain. According to this report, it was then in
            much the same state as described by modern travelers, and the
            same mystery surrounded it, showing that it must have been in
            ruin much longer than the short space of time from the conquest
            to the date of his report. But few travelers have visited Copan,
            and fewer still have left a good description of it.
            Mr. Stephens, accompanied by Mr. Catherwood, explored it in
            1839, and this constitutes our main source of information.

        <p class="indentedText">
            We feel that here is the place to speak a word of caution.
            In common with other writers, we have used the word cities, in
            speaking of the ruins of Maya civilization. In view of the
            criticisms that have been freely expressed by some of the best
            scholars of American ethnology, as to the generally accepted
            view of the civilization of the Mexican and Central American
            races, it is necessary to be on our guard as to the language
            employed. In the case of Copan, for instance, all the remains
            known, occur in an irregularly inclosed space of about nine
            hundred by sixteen hundred feet, while but a portion of such
            inclosed space is covered by the ruins themselves. Now it can,
            of course, be said that this space contains simply the remains
            of public buildings, so to speak--such as temples, palaces, and
            others--while the habitations of the great body of the common
            people, poorly built, and located outside of this area, may have
            vanished away. But, on the other hand, it may also be that in
            this small area we have the ruins of all the buildings that ever
            stood at Copan. In which case the word city is a misnomer;
            pueblo would be more appropriate. But looking at them in the
            simplest light, we shall find there is still a great deal to
            excite astonishment. Fragments of the wall originally inclosing
            the area in which are located the temple pyramids and statues,
            are still to be found. Very few particulars have been given of
            this wall. It was made of blocks of stone, and seems to have
            been twenty-five feet thick at the base, but the height is not
            given. The northern half of this area is occupied by a large
            terrace, somewhat irregular in outline, and impressed
            Mr. Stephens with the idea that it had not all been erected at
            the same time, but additions had been made from time to time.
            Instead of describing the ruins in full, we will let the
            illustration speak for itself. The dimensions of this terrace
            are, six hundred and twenty-four feet by eight hundred and nine
            feet. The side fronting on the river was perpendicular.
            The other three sides consist of ranges of steps and pyramidal
            structures. All these steps and pyramidal sides were once
            painted. The general height of the terrace was about seventy
            feet above the surface of the ground.
        </p>


        <figure class="right">

            <figcaption>Ruins of Copan.</figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p class="indentedText">
            Though Mr. Stephens warns us that this terrace was not as large
            as the base of the Pyramid of Ghizeh, still it must have
            required an immense amount of work, since careful computations
            show that over twenty-six million cubic feet of stone were used
            in its construction. This stone was brought from the quarries
            two miles away. We must not forget that this work was performed
            by a people destitute of metallic tools.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            On the terrace were the ruins of four pyramids, one rising to
            the height of one hundred and twenty-two feet. The surface of
            the terrace was not continuous. In two places there were
            court-yards, or sunken areas. The larger is ninety by one
            hundred and forty-four feet, and has a narrow passage-way
            leading into it from the north. Whatever buildings that once
            stood on this terrace, have vanished away. At one place only, on
            the terrace, fronting the river, are the remains of small,
            circular towers, thought to have been watch towers. The whole
            terrace was thickly overgrown by trees of a tropical growth.
            Mr Stephens noticed two immense Ceiba trees growing from the
            very summit of one of the pyramids. This structure has been
            called the Temple, and a great many surmises have been made as
            to the scenes once enacted there. If analogous to other
            structures in Central America, this terrace was surmounted with
            buildings. They may have been temples or palaces, or they may
            have been communal houses, not unlike those of New Mexico, to
            the north.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But of more importance than the ruins of this temple, are the
            statues and altars peculiar to this region. Mr. Stephens found
            fourteen of them. It seems very singular, indeed, to come upon
            these statues in the depth of a Central American forest, and
            they give us an idea of the state of advancement of these old
            tribes that nothing else does. They raise many queries. Why is
            it that so many are found here--so few elsewhere? Are they
            statues of noted personages, or idols? We are powerless to
            answer these questions. These secrets will only be yielded up
            when the hieroglyphics with which they are covered shall
            be read.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The places where these statues are found is seen to the right of
            the main body of ruins. It will be seen that only one is within
            the terrace area of the temple. Three others are situated near
            it, but the majority are near the southern end of the inclosure.
            We are not given the dimensions of all, but the smallest one
            given is eleven feet, eight inches high, by three feet, four
            inches width and depth; the largest, thirteen feet high, four
            feet wide, and three feet deep. No inconsiderable part of the
            labor on the statues must have been that of quarrying the large
            blocks of stone out of which they were carved, and transporting
            them to the place where found. They came from the same quarry as
            the other stones used in building; and so were transported a
            distance of about two miles. Mr. Stephens found, about midway to
            the quarry, a gigantic block, "which was probably on its way
            thither, to be carved and set up as an ornament, when the labors
            of the workmen were arrested."
        </p>

        </figure>


        <p class="indentedText">
            There is such a similarity in all these statues that a
            representation of one will suffice. This is the representation
            of one of the largest statues. It is seen to be standing on a
            sort of pedestal. A face occupies a central position on the
            front. Some of the faces have what may be a representation of a
            beard. In all but one, the expression is calm and peaceful.
            They were once painted red. Traces of color were still visible
            at the time of Mr. Stephens's visit. In all but one the hands
            are represented as placed back to back on the breast.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The complicated headdress and the ornaments on the robes utterly
            defy description. The sides and back of the statues are covered
            with hieroglyphics, though now and then a face is introduced.
            A side view of another statue shows this feature. All are
            convinced that we have in these hieroglyphics an explanation of
            each statue, but what it is, is yet unknown. Mr. Stephens says:
            "Of the moral effect of the monuments themselves, standing as
            they do, in the depths of a tropical forest, silent and solemn,
            strange in design, excellent in sculpture, rich in ornament,
            different from the works of any other people; their uses and
            purposes--their whole history--so entirely unknown, with
            hieroglyphics explaining all, but perfectly unintelligible, I
            shall not pretend to convey any idea. Often the imagination was
            pained in gazing at them. The tone which pervades the ruins is
            that of deep solemnity."
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In front of most of the statues is what is called an altar,
            which would seem to imply that these monuments are really idols.
            "The altars, like the idols, are all of a single block of stone.
            In general, they are not so richly ornamented, and are more
            faded and worn, or covered with moss. Some were completely
            buried, and of others it was difficult to make out more than the
            form. All differed in position, and doubtless had some distinct
            and peculiar reference to the idols before which they stood."
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            These altars are strongly suggestive of sacrificial scenes.
            The altar before the idol found in the court-yard on the terrace
            of the temple, is one of the most interesting objects found at
            Copan. It is six feet square and four feet high. The top is
            divided into thirty-six tablets of hieroglyphics which we may
            well imagine records some events in the history of this
            mysterious people. Each side has carved on it four human
            figures. They are generally all represented as facing the same
            way. We give an illustration of the east side. Each individual
            is sitting cross-legged on a hieroglyphic, and has a ponderous
            head-dress.

            Mr Stephens found the quadrangle at the south-east corner of the
            plan to be thickly strewn with fragments of fine sculpture.
            Amongst the rest was a "remarkable portrait." (Shown later.)
            "It is probably the portrait of some king, chieftain, or sage.
            The mouth is injured, and part of the ornament over the wreath
            that crowns the head. The expression is noble and severe, and
            the whole character shows a close imitation of nature."
            Colonel Gallindo, who visited Copan in 1835, discovered a vault
            very near where the circular towers are located, on the terrace
            fronting the river. This vault was five feet wide, ten feet
            long, and four feet high. It was used for burial purposes.
            Over fifty vessels of red pottery, containing human bones, were
            found in it.

            In this hasty sketch we do not feel that we have done justice to
            Copan. It is, however, all the space we can devote to this
            interesting ruin. We call special attention to the hieroglyphics
            on the altar and the statues. We will find other hieroglyphics
            at Palenque, and in Yucatan, evidently derived from these.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='"Report of Bureau of Ethnology," Vol. I. Mr. HoldenÂ´s article.'>[4]</a>

            They have been made the subject of very interesting study, and
            we will refer to them again at another page. We also notice
            especially the fact that we have no ruined buildings at Copan.
            In this respect it stands almost alone among the Central
            American ruins. The distinguishing features, however, are the
            carved obelisks. They are evidently not the work of rude,
            people. Mr. Stephens, who was every way qualified to judge,
            declares that some of them "are in every way equal to the finest
            Egyptian workmanship, and that with the best instruments of
            modern times, it would be impossible to cut stone
            more perfectly."

            A dark mystery hangs over these ruins. Their builders are
            unknown. Whether we have here some temple sacred to the gods of
            the Maya pantheon or some palace made resplendent for royal
            owners, who can tell? Whether these are the ruins of the more
            substantial public buildings of a great city, of which all other
            buildings have vanished--or whether this is the remains of a
            prosperous pueblo, whose communal houses crowded the terraces,
            with sacrificial altars on the lofty pyramids--who knows? At
            long intervals a passing traveler visits them, ponders over
            their fast disappearing ruins, and goes his way. The veil drops,
            the tropical forest more securely environs them--and thus the
            years come and go over the ruins of Copan.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Nearly north from Copan (see map), about half-way to the coast,
            on the bank of the river Montagua, is found a small hamlet, by
            the name of Quiriga. Mr. Stephens, when traveling in the country
            in 1840, after many careful inquiries, heard of ruins near that
            place. Though not able to explore them himself, his companion,
            Mr. Catherwood, did. The result of this gentleman's exertion
            makes us acquainted with another group of ruins, in many
            respects similar to those of Copan, though apparently much
            farther gone in decay. His visit was a very hurried one; and he
            was not able to clear the moss away from the statues so as to
            draw them as it should be done.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='Fourteen years later, these ruins were visited and described by an Austrian traveler, Dr. Scherzer. His account, though much more complete than Mr. StephensÂ´s, has not yet appeared in English. Mr. Bancroft, in "Native Races," Vol. IV, p. 118, et seq., gives a rÃ©sumÃ© of all information known as to these ruins.'>[5]</a>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            We must notice that, though called a city, all the monuments and
            fragments thus far brought to light are scattered over a space
            of some three thousand square feet. No plan has been given.
            We gather, however, from Stephens's work, that a pyramidal wall
            inclosed the ruins, as at Copan.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='"Central America," Vol II, p. 122. We are not sure about this inclosure. But Mr. Catherwood mentions a wall, and we are told the ruins are, in all respects, similar to those of Copan.'>[6]</a>
            No dimensions of this wall
            are given. Within the inclosure (if such it was) was a terrace.
            Here, again, dimensions are not given; but we are told it was
            about twenty-five feet to the top, and that the steps were, in
            some places, still perfect. It was constructed of neatly cut
            sandstone blocks. No monuments or altars were observed on the
            terrace, but in close proximity to it were fragments of
            sculpture. At another place near the wall, Mr. Catherwood
            mentions eight standing statues, one fallen one, and saw
            fragments of at least thirteen others. They are represented as
            being very similar to those of Copan, but two or three times as
            high. The hieroglyphics are pronounced identical with those
            already described.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There are no traditions extant of these ruins. No thorough
            exploration has been made. A city may have stood there; but, if
            so, its name is lost, its history unknown. "For centuries it has
            lain as completely buried as if covered with the lava of
            Vesuvius. Every traveler from Yzabel to Guatemala has passed
            within three hours of it. We ourselves have done the same;
            and yet there it lay, like the rock-built city of Edom,
            unvisited, unsought, and utterly unknown."
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A large extent of territory in Guatemala and Yucatan is as yet
            an unknown country, or at least has never been thoroughly
            explored. Strange stories have flitted here and there of wonders
            yet to be seen. The country swarms with savages, living in much
            the same state as they were when the Spaniards invaded the
            country. They have never been conquered, and, in the rugged
            fastnesses of their land, bid defiance to all attempts to
            civilize them. From all we can learn, there are numerous groups
            of ruins scattered here and there--but of their nature we are,
            as yet, mostly in the dark.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            We have, indeed, historical notices of a few places; but, as the
            color of an object is the same as that of the medium through
            which it is viewed, we can not help thinking that the glamour of
            romance, which the early Spanish writers threw around all their
            transactions in the New World, has woefully distorted these
            sketches. This same effect is to be noticed in all the
            descriptions of the ruins. Where one party sees the ruins of
            imperial cities, another can detect but the ruins of imposing
            pueblos, with their temples and pyramids. It can be truthfully
            stated, that this is a land of ruins. Every few leagues, as far
            as it has been explored, are the remains of structures that
            excite astonishment.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The meager reports given us raise our curiosity, but fail to
            satisfy it. Almost all explorers relate stories of the existence
            of an aboriginal city. The location of this city shifts from
            place to place; always, however, in a section of country where
            no white men are allowed to intrude. The Cure of Santa Cruz, in
            whom Mr. Stephens expressed confidence, declared that he had,
            years before, climbed to the summit of a lofty sierra, and then
            "he looked over an immense plain, extending to Yucatan and the
            Gulf of Mexico, and saw, at a great distance, a large city,
            spread over a great space, with turrets white and glittering in
            the sun." We are afraid a search for this mythical city would be
            attended with much the same results as rewards the child's
            pursuit of a golden treasure at the end of the rainbow.

            As a sample of known ruins, we might cite two in the immediate
            neighborhood of Quirigua. At the distance of a few leagues, both
            above and below this latter place, are the remains of former
            settlements. The accounts are very brief. Of the ruins below, we
            are informed that they consist of the remains of a quadrilateral
            pyramid, with traced sides, up which steps lead to the summit
            platform, where <i>debris</i> of hewn stone are enveloped in
            dense vegetation." Of the ruins located above Quirigua, we are
            simply told "of a large area covered with aboriginal relics--in
            the form of ruined stone structures, vases and idols of burned
            clay, and monoliths, buried for the most part in the earth."

        <p class="indentedText">
            These descriptions will serve as samples of many others, and,
            though they are interesting in their way, we are afraid they
            would grow tiresome by repetition. We will, therefore, only make
            mention of one or two important points; premising, however,
            that, beyond a doubt, similar ruins are scattered up and down
            the river valleys of the entire country.

            Two cities of ancient Guatemala especially mentioned by Spanish
            writers are Utatlan and Patinamit. Here, if we may believe their
            recitals, were the capitals of two powerful monarchies.
            The pictures they draw for us are those of cities of Oriental
            magnificence. The system of government they describe is that of
            absolute monarchy, founded on feudalism. We will briefly glance
            at the remains of these "imperial cities." Their location is
            seen on the map. The approach to Patinamit is very difficult,
            indeed. Situated on a high table-land, it commands an almost
            boundless view. On every side are immense ravines, and the only
            way of entering it was by a narrow passage cut in the side of
            the ravine, twenty or thirty feet deep, and not wide enough for
            two horsemen to ride abreast.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Mr. Stephens mentions coming to a wall of stone, but broken and
            confused. The ground beyond was covered with mounds of ruins,
            and in one place he saw the foundations of two buildings, one of
            them being one hundred and fifty by fifty feet. He does not give
            us the area covered by the ruins, but there is nothing in his
            description to make us think it very large in extent. He also
            quotes for us Fuentes's description of this same place, written,
            however, one hundred and forty years earlier. In this he speaks
            of the remains of a magnificent building, perfectly square, each
            side measuring one hundred paces, constructed of hewn stones,
            extremely well put together. In front of the building is a large
            square, on one side of which stand the ruins of a sumptuous
            palace; and near to it are the foundations of several houses.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='"Central America," Vol. II, pp. 152-3.'>[8]</a>
            He also asserts that traces of streets could still be seen, and
            that they were straight and spacious, crossing each other at
            right angles. Fuentes certainly had remarkable eyes. He wrote a
            description of Copan which not only differs from all accounts of
            modern travelers, but also from the still earlier description by
            Garcia De Palacio.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='Brasseur De Bourbourg styles FuentesÂ´s description of Copan "La description menteuse de Fuentes." Bancroft: "Native Races," Vol. IV, p. 80, note.'>[9]</a>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Patinamit means "The City," and is represented as the capital
            city of the Cakchiquel "monarchy." The site of the city was
            certainly admirably chosen for defense, and we have no doubt but
            what here was the head-quarters of a powerful tribe of Indians;
            but, until scholars have settled some very disputed points about
            the civilization of the Central American nations, we must be
            cautious in the use of the words monarchy and palaces as applied
            to these old people or these ruins.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Thirty-five or forty miles north-eastward from Patinamit we come
            to the ruins of the most renowned city in Guatemala at the time
            of the conquest. This was Utatlan, the Quiche capital, a city
            which the Spaniards compared to Mexico in magnificence, and
            which, at the time of its destruction, was at its zenith of
            prosperity. The location was very similar to that of Patinamit.
            It also stood on an elevated plateau, with immense ravines on
            every side. It was approached only at one point, and guarding
            this one point of approach was a line of fortifications.
            They consisted of the remains of stone buildings, probably
            towers. The stones were well cut and laid together.
            These fortifications were united by a ditch.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Within this line of towers stood a structure, generally regarded
            as a fort, directly guarding the line of approach. Steps led up
            a pyramidal structure having three terraces, one over the other.
            The top was protected by a wall of stone, and from the center
            rose a tower. Beyond this fort was the ruins of the city.
            Mr. Stephens describes a large ruin which is called The Palace.
            It is said, in round numbers, to have been eleven hundred by
            twenty-two hundred feet. As this area is more than fifty-five
            acres in extent, we can see it was not a palace in our sense of
            the word. The stones of which it was composed have been largely
            removed to build the modern town of Santa Cruz. But the floor
            could still be traced, and some remains of partition walls.
            The floor was still covered with hard cement.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Adjoining the palace was a large plaza or court-yard, also
            cemented, in the center of which was the ruins of a fountain.
            Another structure still remaining was a small pyramid, at the
            top of which was probably a temple, or, at least, a place of
            sacrifice. No hieroglyphics or statues have been found here.
            A few terra-cotta figures have been found, and one small gold
            image. It would seem from this description that the ruins simply
            consist of a few large structures. For aught we know, they may
            have been communal houses.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Mr. Stephens, however, condenses Fuentes's account, which is
            truly wonderful. According to him, the center of the city was
            occupied by the royal palaces, around which were grouped the
            houses of the nobles. The extremities were inhabited by the
            plebeians. He tells us there were many sumptuous buildings, the
            most superb of which was a seminary, where between five and six
            thousand children were educated at royal expense. The palace was
            formed of hewn stones of various colors. There were six
            principal divisions. In one was lodged the king's body-guard, in
            the second the princes and the relatives of the king, and
            so forth.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            It is not necessary to remind the reader that it is very
            doubtful whether such a state of things ever existed. It is
            related, for instance, that the king marched from Utatlan with
            seventy-two thousand warriors to repel the attack of Alvarade.
            This would indicate a total population of between two and three
            hundred thousand souls. It seems to us that a city of that size
            would not so completely disappear in a little over three
            centuries that a careful explorer could find only the ruins of a
            few large buildings.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            We do not feel that we have done near justice to the ruins of
            Guatemala. As we have before remarked, there are, doubtless,
            many ruins not yet brought to light. They are rapidly
            disappearing, and we do not know that we will ever possess a
            description of them, or understand their real import. The light
            of history, indeed, fell on the two groups of ruins last
            described. But the Spanish writers were totally unacquainted
            with Indian society, and may, therefore, have widely erred in
            applying to their government terms suited only to European ideas
            of the sixteenth century. And it is not doubted but that their
            estimate of the population of the towns, and of the enemies with
            which they had to contend, were often greatly overdrawn.
            In short, the remains themselves are remarkable, but every
            ruined pyramid is not necessarily the remains of a great very
            great city, nor every large building in ruins necessarily
            a palace.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Going northward out of Guatemala, we pass into the modern state
            of Chiapas. This is described a country of great natural beauty
            and fertility. And here it is that we meet with a group of ruins
            which have been an object of great interest to the scientific
            world. They have been carefully studied and described, and many
            theories have been enunciated as to their builders, their
            history, and civilization. The place is supposed to have been
            deserted and in ruins when Cortez landed in the country. At any
            rate, he marched within a few leagues of it, but, as in the case
            of Copan, he is silent in regard to it.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            They take their name from the modern town of Palenque, near
            which they are located. This town was founded in 1564. It was
            once a place of considerable importance, but its trade has died
            away, and now it would not be known were it not for the ruins of
            a former people located near it. Though distant from the village
            only some eight miles, nearly two centuries went by before their
            existence was known. Had they been visited and described at the
            time of the founding of the village, no doubt much that is now
            mysterious in regard to them would have been cleared away.
            But for two centuries they were allowed to sleep undisturbed in
            the depths of the forest, and in that time the elements played
            sad havoc with the buildings, inscriptions, and ornaments.
            What are left are not sufficient to impart full information.
            Imagination is too apt to supply the details, and these ruins,
            grand in proportion, wonderful in location, enwrapt by dense
            forests, visited by the storms of tropical lands, are made to do
            service in setting forth a picture of society and times which we
            are afraid has but little real foundation to rest upon.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The ruins of Palenque are the first which awakened attention to
            the existence of ancient ruins in America, and, therefore, it
            may not come amiss to state more particularly the circumstances
            of their first discovery. The existence of an aboriginal city in
            this locality was entirely unknown; there were no traditions
            even that it had ever existed. Of course the natives of the
            modern town of Palenque must have known of their existence, but
            no account of them was published. They are said to have been
            discovered in 1750 by a party of traveling Spaniards.
            This statement Mr. Stephens doubts. The first account was
            published in 1784. The Spanish authorities finally ordered an
            exploration. This was made under the auspices of Captain Del
            Rio, who arrived on the ground in 1787. His report was locked up
            in the government archives, and was not made public until 1822.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The reception of this report illustrates how little interest is
            taken in American antiquities. It was scarcely noticed by the
            <i>Scientific World.</i> As Mr. Stephens remarks, "If a like
            discovery had been made in Italy, Greece, Egypt, or Asia, within
            the reach of European travel, it would have created an interest
            not inferior to the discovery of Herculaneum, or Pompeii, or the
            ruins of Paestum." But, from some cause, so little notice was
            taken of this report that in 1831 the explorations of Colonel
            Galindo, whose works we have referred to at Copan, was spoken of
            as a new discovery. In the meantime another government
            expedition under the direction of Captain Dupaix explored these
            ruins in 1807. Owing to the wars in Europe and the revolution in
            Mexico, his report was not published until 1835. Mr. Stephens
            visited the ruins in 1840. His account, profusely illustrated,
            was the means of making known to a large class of readers the
            wonderful nature of the ruins, not only at Palenque, but in
            Yucatan as well.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In this outline we have given an account of the early
            explorations at Palenque. Private individuals have visited them,
            and governments have organized exploring expeditions, and by
            both pencil and pen made us familiar with them. As to the
            remains actually in existence, these accounts agree fairly well,
            but we have some perplexing differences as to the area covered
            by the ruins. Where the early explorers could trace the ruins of
            a large city modern travelers can find but a few ruined
            structures, which, however, excite our liveliest interest.
            One of the earliest accounts speaks of the ruins of over two
            hundred buildings. Another speaks of them as covering an area of
            many square miles. Mr. Stephens thinks a few acres
            would suffice.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            From the researches of M. Charney, it would seem that the ruins
            are really scattered over quite an area. His exploration made in
            1881, seems to confirm the older writers. With abundant means at
            his command, he was enabled to explore the forest, and he found
            many ruins which escaped the other observers. According to him,
            the ruins are scattered over an area extending about one mile
            and a quarter from north to south, and about one and
            three-fourths from east to west. Throughout this space, the
            ruined structures were in all respects similar to those
            previously described, consisting altogether of what he calls
            palaces and temples.

            There seems to be no especial order in the arrangement of the
            buildings. They are separated by quite an interval, excepting to
            the south of the palace, where there are groups of buildings
            near together. The fact that such careful explorers as Stephens
            and Waldeck failed to notice these additional ruins, gives us a
            faint idea of the density of the forest.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The plan represents the distribution and relative size of the
            ruins of which we have definite descriptions. Those having no
            numbers are some of the groups that were passed by as of no
            account. We must understand that so dense is the forest that not
            one of these structures is visible from its neighbors. Where the
            trees are cut down, as they have been several times, only a few
            years are necessary for it to regain its former density, and
            each explorer must begin anew.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The largest structure, marked one on the plan, is known as the
            palace. This is only a conjectural name. We have no reason,
            except its size, to suppose it the residence of a royal owner.
            Its base is a pyramid which, Mr. Stephens tells us, is of oblong
            form, forty feet high, three hundred and ten feet in front and
            rear, and two hundred and sixty feet on each side. The pyramid
            was formerly faced with stone, which has been thrown down by the
            growth of trees, so that its form is hardly distinguishable.
            The sides may once have been covered with cement, and perhaps
            painted. Dupaix, who examined these ruins in 1808, so represents
            them. Mr. Stephens expressly states that the eastern front was
            the principal entrance. Mr. Waldeck, however, detected traces of
            stairways on the northern side. M. Charney has settled the
            point, that the principal entrance was on the northern side.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The principal bulk of this pyramid seems to have been earth;
            the facing only being composed of stone. Mr. Bancroft thinks he
            has discovered evidence that there were four or more thick
            foundation-walls built from the surface of the ground to support
            the buildings on top of the pyramid; that the space between
            these walls was subsequently filled with earth, and that sloping
            embankments, faced with stones, were built upon the outside.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='"Native Races," Vol. IV, p. 300, et seq.'>[11]</a>
            The summit platform of this pyramid supports the building, or
            collection of buildings, known as the palace. Though generally
            spoken of as one building, we think we have here the ruins of a
            number of buildings.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Probably the original inhabitants built a continuous structure
            close to the edge of the platform, leaving the interior for an
            open court. Subsequently, as population increased, rather than
            resort to the labor necessary to raise a new pyramidal
            structure, they erected other buildings on this court. From the
            plan, as given by Mr. Stephens, there seems to have been no less
            than five such put up, besides the tower. Thus covering the
            platform with a somewhat confused mass of buildings, and,
            instead of the large open court, there were left only three
            narrow courts, and one somewhat larger--seventy by eighty
            feet.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='MorganÂ´s "Contribution to N.A. Ethnology," Vol. IV, p. 268.'>[12]</a>
            The building erected near the edge of the platform,
            inclosing the court, was some two hundred and twenty-eight feet
            on its east and west sides, by one hundred and eighty feet on
            its north and south sides, and about thirty feet high.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Our general view, taken from Mr. Stephens's works, represents
            the ruined eastern front of this building, surmounting the
            pyramid. Trees are seen growing all over the ruins. The outer
            wall is pierced by numerous doorways which, being somewhat wider
            than the space that separates them, gives to the whole the
            appearance of a portico with wide piers: no remains of the doors
            themselves have been discovered. Drilled holes in the projecting
            cornice, immediately above the doorway, gave Mr. Stephens the
            impression that an immense cotton curtain, perhaps painted in a
            style corresponding with the ornaments, had been extended the
            whole front, which was raised or lowered, according to the
            weather. The lintels of the doors were of wood. They had long
            since vanished, and the stones over the doorway fallen down.
            Of the piers separating the doorways, only fifteen were found
            standing, but the crumbling remains of the others were readily
            traced on the ruins.

        </figure>


        <p class="indentedText">
            Each of the standing piers, and presumably all the others, was
            ornamented with a bas-relief in stucco. This cut gives us a good
            example of this style of ornamentation. We notice portions of a
            richly ornamented border. This stucco work consists of human
            figures in various attitudes, having a variety of dress,
            ornaments, and insignia. The stucco is said to be nearly as hard
            as the stone itself. Traces of paint, with which the figures
            were once ornamented, were still to be seen. The conjectures in
            regard to these figures, have been innumerable. Vividly painted,
            and placed in a conspicuous place on the wall, we may be very
            sure they were full of significance to the builders.
            Three hieroglyphics are placed over the head of each group, but
            so far, they are as little understood as the figures themselves.
            We can imagine the effect, when the building was still perfect
            and entire, and all the piers were thus ornamented.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Passing to the top of the pyramid, we find the construction of
            the building whose outer wall we have been describing, to be
            substantially as follows: Three parallel walls, from two to
            three feet in thickness, composed of hewn stones, were erected
            about nine feet apart. At the height of ten feet, the walls
            commenced approaching each other; not, however, in an arch, for
            this was unknown, but in a triangular manner, the stones in each
            course projecting a little farther out. This cut represents a
            cross-section of the buildings, and shows also the slight
            cornice. All inequalities in the surface, as here represented,
            were then filled with cement, thus furnishing a smooth surface,
            which was then painted. The two outer walls were plentifully
            supplied with doorways; the central wall had but few. We are
            only given the description of one, which may not apply to all.
            This one, opposite the entrance on the east side, has a
            trefoil-shaped arch over the door, thus giving it this shape.
            Besides the few doorways, the central wall had numerous
            depressions, or niches, some of which served for ventilation,
            others for the support of beams, and perhaps others as
            receptacles for torches or idols. This principle of construction
            is substantially the same for all the buildings in the interior
            of the court, and indeed for all the buildings at Palenque.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Passing through the doorway just described, we come into the
            second corridor, and continuing through that, we come to what
            was once a large court; but, as we stated, it was subsequently
            built over so as to leave only a few courts. The largest one,
            eighty by seventy feet, is immediately before us, with a range
            of steps leading down into it. On each side of the stairway is
            sculptured, on stucco, a row of grim and gigantic figures.
            The engraving opposite represents the same. "They are adorned
            with rich headdresses and necklaces, but their attitude is that
            of pain and trouble. The design and anatomical proportions of
            the figures are faulty, but there is a force of expression about
            them which shows the skill and conceptive force of the artist."
            From this small court stairways lead to the other buildings
            situated around it.

            Stucco ornaments were plentiful. In one room, rather more richly
            ornamented than the others, was found a stone tablet, which is
            the only important piece of stone sculpture about the palace.
            We are told it is of hard stone, four feet long by three feet
            wide, and the sculpture is in bas-relief. It is set in the wall,
            and around it are the remains of a rich stucco border. Its
            significance is unknown. We must notice the small medallion,
            containing a face, suspended by a necklace of pearls from the
            neck of the principal figure. Mr. Stephens conjectures that it
            may represent the sun. Mr. Waldeck gives a drawing of this same
            subject; but instead of a face, he represents a cross.

        <p class="indentedText">
            In the general view we see a tower rising up from the mass of
            ruins. Mr. Stephens speaks of this tower as follows. "This tower
            is conspicuous by its height and proportions, but an examination
            in detail is found unsatisfactory and uninteresting. The base is
            thirty feet square, and it has three stories. Entering over a
            heap of rubbish at the base, we found within another tower
            distinct from the outer one, and a stone staircase, so narrow
            that a large man could not ascend it. The staircase terminated
            against a dead stone ceiling, closing all further passages, the
            last step being only six or eight inches from it. For what
            purpose a staircase was carried up to such a bootless
            termination we could not conjecture. The whole tower was a
            substantial stone structure, and in its arrangements and
            purposes about as incomprehensible as the sculptured tablets."

        <p class="indentedText">
            At the best we can do, it is hard to give such a description of
            this ruin that it can be readily understood, so we will present
            a restoration of it by a German artist,

            This is very useful to us, since it
            conveys an idea of how the palace looked when it was complete.
            This view also includes a second structure, which we will
            examine soon. We notice the numerous doorways leading into the
            first corridor, the ornamental pier-like portions of the wall
            separating the doors, and the several buildings on the court;
            rising over all, the tower, which would have been better if the
            spire had been omitted.

        <p class="indentedText">
            This may have been a real palace. Its rooms may have been the
            habitations of royalty, and its corridors may have resounded
            with the tread of noble personages. M. Charney thinks the palace
            must have been the home of priests, and not kings--in fact, that
            it was a monastery, where the priests lived who ministered in
            the neighboring temples. He thinks Palenque was a holy place, a
            prehistoric Mecca. We must he cautious about accepting any
            theory until scholars are more agreed about the plan of
            government and society among the Central American tribes.
            But, whatever it was, many years have passed by since it was
            deserted. For centuries tropical storms have beat against the
            stuccoed figures. The court-yards and corridors are overrun with
            vegetation, and great trees are growing on the very top of the
            tower. So complete is the ruin that it is with difficulty the
            plan can be made out. The traveler, as he gazes upon it, can
            scarcely resist letting fancy restore the scene as it was
            before the hand of ruin had swept over it. In imagination he
            beholds it perfect in its amplitude and rich decoration, and
            occupied by the strange people whose portraits and figures may
            perhaps adorn its walls.

        <p class="indentedText">
            e must now describe the more important of the remaining
            structures of Palenque. Glancing at the plan for a moment, we
            see to the south-west of the palace a ruin marked 2. This is the
            site of a pyramidal structure known as the "Temple of the Three
            Tablets," or "Temple of Inscriptions." The pyramid is not as
            large in area as the palace, though of a greater height.
            It measures in height one hundred and ten feet on the slope, but
            we are not given the other dimensions. All the sides, which were
            very steep, seem to have had steps. Trees have grown up all over
            the pyramid and on the top of the building. This illustration,
            taken from Mr. Stephens's work, can not fail to impress on us
            the luxuriant growth of tropical vegetation, and we can also see
            how such a growth must accelerate the ruin. The stone steps
            leading up the sides of the pyramid have been thrown down, and
            such must be in time the fate of the building itself.
            The building on the summit platform does not cover all the area.
            It is seventy-six feet front by twenty-five feet deep and
            about thirty-five feet high.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This small cut is a representation of the same building on a
            small scale, but cleared of trees and vines. The roof is seen to
            consist of two parts, sloping at different angles. The lower
            part was covered with stucco ornaments, which, though too much
            injured to be drawn, gave the impression that, when perfect and
            painted, they must have been rich and imposing. The upper slope
            is of solid masonry. "Along the top was a range of pillars,
            eighteen inches high and twelve apart, made of small pieces of
            stone laid in mortar and covered with stucco, having somewhat
            the appearance of a low, open balustrade."

            In this wood-cut the front wall, as in the palace, presents more
            the appearance of a row of piers than any thing else. Each of
            the corner piers contains on its surface hieroglyphics, each of
            which contains ninety-six squares. The other piers have
            ornaments of stucco similar to those we have already examined on
            the palace. In the building itself we have the usual three
            parallel walls. In this case, however, the second corridor is
            divided into three rooms, and there is no opening in the third
            wall, unless it be three small openings for air. The central
            wall is four or five feet thick.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='BancroftÂ´s "Native Races," p. 326.'>[16]</a>
            The interior is very plain.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The principal point of interest about the building, from whence
            the name is derived, is three tablets of hieroglyphics. One on
            either side of the principal doorway of the middle wall, and the
            third in the rear wall of the middle room. Being so similar to
            other tablets, it is not necessary to give separate cuts of
            them. The similarity to those of Copan is very great, the
            differences being in minute points, which only critical
            examination would detect. Mr. Stephens tells us that the Indians
            call this building a school. The priests who came to visit him
            at the ruins called it a temple of justice, and said the tablets
            contained the law. We do not think either are very safe guides
            to follow.

        <p class="indentedText">
            At number three on the plan are the ruins of an edifice which is
            fast disappearing. The outer wall had already fallen at the time
            of Mr. Stephens's visit. It stands on the bank of the stream.
            The pyramid base is one hundred feet high on the slope.
            The building on the top is twenty-five feet front by eighteen
            feet deep. In the inner corridor could be dimly traced the
            outlines of a beautiful piece of stucco work. At the time of
            Waldeck's visit it was still complete, so we are enabled to give
            a cut of it.

            We are sure the readers will not fail to notice the many points
            which make this such an exceptionally fine piece of work. In the
            original drawing the grace of the arms and wrists is truly
            matchless, and the chest muscles are displayed in the most
            perfect manner. The embroidered girdle and folded drapery of the
            figure, as well as the drapery around the leopard's neck, are
            arranged with taste. The head-dress is not unlike a Roman helmet
            in front, with the addition of numerous plumes. The sandals of
            the feet are secured by a cord and rosette, while the ornaments
            on the animal's ankles seem secured by leather straps.

            Mr. Waldeck, however, who drew this sketch, is supposed to have
            drawn at times better than his model.

            This is generally
            called the "Temple of the Beau-relief." Mr. Holden, in his able
            article already referred to, comes to the conclusion that this
            figure represents the god Quetzalcohuatl, the nature god of
            the Mayas.

            Eastward from the palace, and across the creek, are seen on the
            plan the location of two other structures. The one marked is a
            somewhat famous structure, which, for reasons that will soon
            appear, is called the "Temple of the Cross." The pyramid in this
            case is one hundred and thirty-four feet on the slope.
            It, however, stands on a terrace about sixty feet on the slope.
            The forest is so dense that, though other structures are but a
            short distance from it, yet they can not be seen. The last two
            engravings represent the building and the ground plan. This is
            not a fanciful sketch, but is a restoration, "from such remains
            and indications that it is impossible to make any thing else out
            of it."

            "The building is fifty feet front, thirty-one feet deep, and has
            three door-ways. The whole front was covered with stucco
            ornaments. The two outer piers contain hieroglyphics." We notice
            a new feature about the roof. It is similar to the roof of the
            temple of the "Three Tablets," in having two different
            slopes--the lower one covered with stucco ornaments, but the
            range of pillars along the roof is here replaced by a peculiar
            two-storied arrangement nearly sixteen feet high. Mr. Stephens
            says: "The long sides of this narrow structure are of open
            stucco-work, formed into curious and indescribable devices,
            human figures with legs and arms spreading and apertures
            between, and the whole was once loaded with rich and elegant
            ornaments in stucco relief. Its appearance at a distance must
            have been that of a high, fanciful lattice. It was perfectly
            unique--different from the works of any other people with which
            we are familiar, and its uses and purposes entirely
            incomprehensible."

            It was evidently added to the temple solely for the sake of
            appearance. One writer
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='Brasseur De Bourbourg.'>[19]</a>
            believes the roof structures were
            erected by some people that succeeded the original builders of
            the temple. The plan of the temple gives us a clear idea of the
            arrangement of the inner rooms. Our principal interest centers
            in the altar, which we notice placed in the center of the back
            room. We give an illustration of a similar altar-form in the
            temple, at number 5 of the plan. In form it is that of an
            inclosed chamber, having a roof of its own. The altar in the
            Temple of the Cross was very similar to this. Mr. Stephens's
            description is as follows: "The top of the doorway was gorgeous
            with stuccoed ornaments, and on the piers at each side were
            stone tablets in bas-relief. Within, the chamber is thirteen
            feet wide and seven feet deep."

            The room was plain within, and right against the back was the
            famous "Tablet of the Cross." This tablet was six feet four
            inches high, ten feet eight inches wide, and formed of three
            stones. The right-hand one is now in the National Museum in
            Washington. The central one, though torn from its original
            place, is still at the ruins. The next cut gives us only the
            sculptured part of the tablet. On both the right and left-hand
            were tablets of hieroglyphics. A long chain of ornaments hung
            suspended from the cap of the right-hand figure. The two figures
            are regarded as priests. The cross is very plainly outlined, and
            is the regular Latin one. Considerable discussion has arisen as
            to what supports the cross. Dr. Brinton thinks it a serpent.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='"Myths of the New World."'>[20]</a>

            We must also notice the bird

            species. The right-hand figure is offering it something.

            We must refer to some more tablets found at Palenque before
            proceeding further. At number five of the plan was a temple but
            little smaller than the one just described. There is, however,
            such a similarity between the buildings, that it is not
            necessary to give illustrations. The temple, also, had an
            inclosed altar; and against the back of that was placed the
            tablet which was very similar to the one just described.
            This illustration represents the sculptured portions. On each
            side were tablets of hieroglyphics. It needs but a glance to
            show that the priests are, evidently, the same personages as in
            the other tablet.

            The one on the left is standing on the back of a human being.
            The one on the right is, perhaps, standing on a beast; or, if a
            human being, he is crushed beneath the weight of the priest.
            Two other human figures support a platform, from which rise two
            batons crossed like a St. Andrew's cross. These support a mask,
            from the center of which a hideous human face looks out.
            The Aztecs sometimes represented the sun by such a mask, and
            hence the name "Temple of the Sun."

        <p class="indentedText">
            In still another temple, situated but a short distance from the
            others, was discovered a third tablet, which is shown in the cut
            opposite. We give all the tablet, showing the hieroglyphics as
            well. We must compare this with the first tablet given.
            The priests are, evidently, the same--but, notice, they stand on
            different sides of the cross. The same priest is making the
            offering as in the first, and the same bird is seen on the top
            of the cross. The priests stand on flowered ornaments.
            The support of the cross resembles the same thing as in the
            first but whether it is a human skull, or a serpent, is hard to
            tell. The cross itself is not as well outlined. The two arms are
            floral ornaments. We must also notice the two faces seen on the
            upright part.

            These tablets are all of great interest. That of the cross, the
            first one given, has attracted more attention than almost any
            other in the field of American antiquities. This is largely
            owing to the cross. As far as the sacred emblem itself is
            concerned, we do not think this tablet of more significance than
            that of the sun. It is well known that the cross, as a sacred
            emblem, had peculiar significance in the ancient religions of
            the world. Its use as such has come down to us from time
            immemorial. On the first expedition of the Spaniards, in 1518,
            to the coast and islands of Yucatan, they discovered that the
            cross was of some significance to the natives. In the island of
            Cozumel they found a large cross, to which the natives prayed
            for rain.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Mr. Brinton thinks that the source of this veneration of the
            cross, like the the sacredness of the number four, of which he
            gives numerous illustrations, is the four cardinal points.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='"Myths of the New World," p. 95.'>[24]</a>
            From these points blow the four winds which bring the
            fertilizing rains, and thus render the earth fruitful; and hence
            the cross, in so many and widely separated portions of the
            earth, is used as the symbol of the life-giving, creative, and
            fertilizing principle in nature.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='BancroftÂ´s "Native Races," Vol. V, p. 506.'>[25]</a>
            He thinks this is, perhaps,
            the significance of these Palenque crosses. It is true we have
            different forms of the cross; but in ancient sculpture they seem
            to have been of equal importance.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The results of these inquiries into the hidden meaning of these
            tablets are not devoid of interest; but, thus far, but few
            conclusions of value have been obtained. They have been made to
            do service in support of some far-fetched theories. The early
            Spanish writers on these subjects concluded that the crosses
            found in Central America were positive proof that St. Thomas had
            traveled through the country preaching the doctrines of
            Christianity. The padres, who came to visit Mr. Stephens at the
            ruins, "at the sight of it, immediately decided that the old
            inhabitants of Palenque were Christians, and fixed the age of
            the buildings in the third century."

        <p class="indentedText">
            Wilson finds in the tablets of the cross a strong argument for
            the existence of a great Phoenician empire in Central America.
            This tablet represents, he thinks, the sacrifice of a child to
            Astarte,
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='"Conquest of Mexico," p. 160.'>[27]</a>
            also called Ashtoreth, the great female deity of
            the ancient Semitic nations on both sides of the Euphrates, but
            chiefly of Phoenicia. The original meaning of this word was
            "Queen of Heaven." Modern scholars do not think these early
            speculations of the slightest worth. Dr. Charles Rau
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='"Smithsonian Contribution to Knowledge," Vol. XXII.'>[28]</a>
            concludes that as reasonable a conjecture as any is the
            supposition that it represents a sacrifice to the god of rain,
            made, perhaps, at a time of drought, apparently influenced to
            that conclusion by the fact that the natives of Cozumel regarded
            a cross in such a light,
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='BancroftÂ´s "Native Races," Vol. III, p. 470.'>[29]</a>

            has made a critical study of the hieroglyphics
            of Copan and Palenque. Though far from complete, most
            interesting results have been obtained. We can not do more than
            set forth the results of his investigations.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip"
               title='Mr. Holden uses, as an important link in his arguments, a figure engraved on a chalchiute (a sacred stone). He concludes it to be a representative of Huitzilopochtli, the god of war, or rather the Maya representative of the Mexican god of that name. It is unfortunate that Prof. Valentine gives to this same figure a different significance. In the "Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society," for April, 1884, in a paper on that subject, he concludes it to be a representation of a victorious warrior giving sacrifice to his god. The only persons entitled to speak on such subjects are those thoroughly acquainted with Maya ArchÃ¦ology.'>[31]</a>
            He concludes,
            from a careful study of the tablets of the cross and of the sun,
            that in both the left-hand priests are representatives of the
            god of war,
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='Huitzilopochtli.'>[32]</a>
            the right-hand priests being in both

            He does
            not state his conclusions in regard to the central figures in
            the tablets. Mr. Brinton thinks the central figure in the tablet
            of the cross is a rebus for the nature god Quetzalcohuatl.
            The cross was one of the symbols of Quetzalcohuatl, as such
            signifying the four winds of which he was lord. Another of his
            symbols was a bird. We notice the two symbols present in the
            tablet. Mr. Holden also finds that the glyph standing for this
            god occurs several times in the tables of hieroglyphics
            belonging to this figure.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            According to these last views, then, the old Palenquians seem to
            have been a very religious people, and Quetzalcohuatl, the god
            of peace, seems to have been their principal deity, differing in
            this regard from Mexico, where all honor was paid to the god of
            war. We are not given any explanation of the Temple of the Three
            Tablets, but the other temples have to do with the worship of
            this benign deity. The beautiful stucco-work in the Temple of
            the Beau-relief, Mr. Holden thinks, also represents him. At the
            Temples of the Cross, if we be right as to the meaning of the
            central figure, the priests of the god of war and the god of
            rain do honor to him.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='While such seem to us to be the results of Mr. HoldenÂ´s labors, it must not be understood that he vouches for them.

            Mr. Bandelier makes a statement in regard to the cross which, if
            it be accepted, clears away a number of theories. He remarks:
            "The cross, though frequently used previously to the conquest by
            the Aborigines of Mexico and Central America as an ornament, was
            not at all an object of worship among them. Besides, there is a
            vast difference between the cross and the crucifix. What has
            been taken for the latter on sculptures, like the 'Palenque
            tablet,' is merely the symbol of the 'Newfire,' or close of a
            period of fifty-two years. It is the fire drill more or less
            ornamented." According to this view, these interesting tablets
            have reference to the ceremonies observed by the Mayas at the
            expiration of a cycle.

            It now only remains to describe some miscellaneous relics

            found. One of the early explorers speaks of finding an earthen
            vessel about a foot in diameter. Waldeck made an exploration in
            a portion of the palace area, and found a gallery containing
            hewn blocks of stone and earthen cups and vases, with many
            little earthen balls of different colors. He also speaks of

            Mr. Stephens was under the impression that they were originally

            The only explanation which we have met is contained in that

            weak part of Mr. Holden's method is his assumption that the
            mythology of the Mayas was the same as that of the Aztecs, when
            the evidence is not strong enough to assert such a fact.

            We feel that we have been somewhat lengthy in describing the
            ruins of Palenque. But it is one of the most important groups of
            ruins that this continent possesses. The most faithful work on
            the part of the scholars of all lands has not as yet succeeded
            in clearing up the mystery connected with it. We can tread the
            courts of their ancient citadel, clamber up to the ruined
            temples and altars, and gaze on the unread hieroglyphics, but,
            with all our efforts, we know but little of its history.
            There was a time when the forest did not entwine these ruins.
            Once unknown priests ministered at these altars. But cacique,
            or king, and priest have alike passed away. The nation, if such
            it was, has vanished, and their descendants are probably to be
            found in the savage tribes of Yucatan to-day. "In the romance of
            the world's history," says Mr. Stephens, "nothing ever impressed
            me more forcibly than the spectacle of this once great and
            lovely city, overturned, desolate, and lost, discovered by
            accident, overgrown with trees for miles around, without even a
            name to distinguish it. Apart from every thing else, it was a
            mournful witness to the world's mutation.

            The ruins at Palenque have been so well known, that but little
            attention has been given to other ruins in the States of Tobasco
            and Chiapas; and yet, according to M. Charney, imposing ruins of
            great extent exist in the western part of Tobasco. At a place
            about thirty-five miles from San Juan, in a north-westerly
            direction, he found veritable mountains of ruins "overgrown with
            a luxuriant vegetation."
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='North American Review, February, 1881, p. 187.'>[41]</a>
            In the absence of cuts, we can not
            do more than give a general idea of these ruins.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            He asserts that the whole State of Tobasco, and part of Chiapas,
            is covered with ruins. One landed proprietor informed him that,
            on his estate, he had counted over three hundred pyramids, all
            of them covered with ruins. In this connection he refers to the
            assertions of some of the early Spanish voyagers, that, when
            skirting the shores of Tobasco, they "saw on the shore, and far
            in the interior, a multitude of structures, whose white and
            polished walls glittered in the sun." On one large pyramid, one
            hundred and fifteen feet high, he found the remains of a
            building two hundred and thirty-five feet long.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This building is named the palace. In this building we met with
            the type that we have learned is the prevailing one further
            south--that is, three parallel walls, forming two rows of rooms.
            In general, the rooms are not well arranged for comfort,
            according to our opinion; but they were, doubtless, well adapted
            to the communal mode of life prevalent among the Indians.
            M. Charney seems to have been strongly impressed with the number
            and importance of the ruins in this State; but, strangely
            enough, others have not mentioned them.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='BancroftÂ´s "Native Races," p. 287.'>[42]</a>
            He says: "I am daily
            receiving information about the ruins scattered all over the
            State of Tobasco, hidden in the forests. ... The imagination
            fails to realize the vast amount of labor it would involve to
            explore even a tithe of these ancient sites. These mountains of
            ruins extend over twelve miles. We still see the hollows in the
            ground whence the soil was taken for the construction of these
            pyramids. But they did not consist merely of clay; bricks, too,
            entered into their construction, and there were strengthening
            walls to make them firmer. These structures are more wonderful
            than the pyramids and the other works at Teotihuacan, and they
            far surpass the pyramids of Egypt.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In the neighboring State of Chiapas, we find the location of
            several groups of ruins. At Ocosingo, we have the evident traces
            of a large settlement. Mr. Stephens mentions four or five
            pyramids crowned with buildings. Immediately beyond these
            pyramids he came upon an open plateau, which he considered to
            have been the site of the city proper. It was protected on all
            sides by the same high terraces, overlooking for a great
            distance the whole country around, and rendering it impossible
            for an enemy to approach from any quarter without being
            discovered. "Across this table was a high and narrow causeway,
            which seemed partly natural and partly artificial, and at some
            distance on which was a mound, with the foundation of a building
            that had probably been a tower. Beyond this the causeway
            extended till it joined a range of mountains. ... There was no
            place we had seen which gave us such an idea of the vastness of
            the works erected by the aboriginal inhabitants."
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='"Central America," Vol. II, p. 261. At this time Mr. Stephens had not seen the ruins at Palenque, and those in Yucatan.'>[43]</a>

        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The ruins at Palenque are considered by some to belong to the
            ancient period of Maya architecture; those we are now to examine
            are regarded as of more modern date. This is at least true with
            respect to the time of their abandonment. Though the efforts of
            explorers in Yucatan have been attended with rich results, still
            few places have been fully described. The country is fairly
            dotted with sites of aboriginal settlements. In all probability
            there are many that are yet unknown. Hidden in tropical jungles,
            they are fast falling into meaningless mounds of <i>debris.</i>
            The early Spanish explorers, skirting the coasts of Yucatan,
            gazed in astonishment at the views they occasionally obtained of
            pyramids crowned with temples and imposing buildings. But this
            gleam of historic light was but momentary in duration. It served
            but to throw a sunset glow over the doomed tribes and
            civilization of the Mayas. By the aid of that dim, uncertain
            light, we are asked to recognize a form of government and
            society which, under the clearer light of modern researches is
            seen to bear an equally strong resemblance to institutions more
            in keeping with the genius of the New World.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The few travelers who visit the country are generally content to
            revisit and describe places already known. This is not strange,
            considering the difficulties that have to be overcome.
            The country swarms with savage Indians, who are jealous of the
            intrusions of strangers. We have, however, this consolation:
            those ruins already brought to light show such a uniformity of
            detail, that it is not probable that any new developments are to
            be expected. The ruins that are already known are sufficient to
            illustrate all the points of their architecture; and we can draw
            from them, doubtless, all that can be drawn from ruins, throwing
            light on the civil organization of the Mayas of Yucatan.

            We can not do better than to describe some of the more important
            ruins, and then notice wherein others differ. Examining the map,
            we see that Uxmal
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='Pronounced "oosh-mal."'>[44]</a>
            is one of the first ruins that would meet
            us on arriving, in the country. It is more fully described than
            any other, though perhaps not of greater importance than those
            of some other localities. As at Palenque, while the principal
            ruins are said to be situated in a small area, the whole section
            abounds in mounds and heaps of <i>debris,</i> and it may well be
            said that buildings as imposing as those already described are
            concealed in the forest not far removed from the present ruins.
            A plat of ground seventeen hundred feet long by twelve hundred
            feet wide would include the principal structures now known.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The most imposing single edifice here is that called the
            Governor's House. The only reason for giving it this name is its
            size. Being of large size, and located on a terraced pyramid, it
            has received a name which may be very inappropriate. We will
            first notice the pyramid on which the building stands.
            At Palenque the pyramid rises regularly from the ground.
            Here the pyramid is terraced. In order to understand clearly the
            arrangement of these various terraces, we introduce this
            drawing. The base is a somewhat irregular figure, though nearly
            a square. Another pyramid cuts into one corner of the terrace.
            The first terrace is about three feet high, fifteen feet broad,
            and five hundred and seventy-five feet long. The second terrace
            is twenty feet high, two hundred and fifty feet wide, and five
            hundred and forty-five feet in length. The third terrace, on
            which the building stands, is nineteen feet high, and its summit
            platform is one hundred by three hundred and sixty feet.
            The height of this platform above the general surface is a
            little over forty feet.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The material of which the pyramid is composed, is rough
            fragments of limestone, thrown together without order; but the
            terraces were all faced with substantial stone work. At the time
            of Mr. Stephens's visit the facing of the second terrace was
            still in a good state of preservation. Charney believes the
            platform was paved with square blocks. This pyramid was not
            entirely artificial--they took advantage of a natural hill, as
            far as it went. No stairway or other means of ascent to the
            first terrace is mentioned. From its low height, probably none
            was needed. The second terrace being twenty feet high, some
            means of ascent was required. This was afforded, as seen in the
            drawing, by an inclined plane, at the south side one hundred
            feet broad. From the second terrace a grand staircase, one
            hundred and thirty feet wide, containing thirty-five steps, led
            up to the summit of the third terrace.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            No buildings or other ornaments are mentioned as having been
            found on the lower terrace. The wide promenade of the second one
            supported some structures of its own, but they were in too
            dilapidated a condition to furnish a clear idea of their
            original nature, except in one instance--that is of the building
            at A of the drawing. This building was ninety-four feet long,
            thirty-four feet wide, and about twenty feet high.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The roof had fallen in, so that we do not know the arrangement
            of the rooms in the interior. The simplicity of ornaments on the
            outer wall is commented on. Instead of the complicated
            ornaments, so apparent on the buildings of Yucatan, the only
            ornament in this case was a simple and elegant line of round
            columns, standing close together, and encircling the whole
            edifice. At regular intervals on the upper cornice appeared a
            sculptured turtle. From this circumstance, the building was
            named "The House of Turtles." No steps lead to the terrace below
            or to the one above. "It stands isolated and alone, seeming to
            mourn over its own desolate and ruinous condition."
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At B, along the south end of the terrace, there was a long, low
            mound of ruins, and arranged along its base was a row of broken
            columns about five feet high and nearly five feet in
            circumference. Some have supposed, from this, that columns
            extended along the entire promenade of the second terrace.
            This would indeed give it a very grand appearance; but there is
            no foundation for such a view. East of the central stairway at
            C, was a low, square inclosure. This contained a standing
            pillar, now in a slanting position, as if an effort had been
            made to throw it over. It was about eight feet above the surface
            of the ground and five below. The Indians called it a
            whipping-post. Mr. Stephens thinks it was connected with the
            ceremonial rites of an ancient worship. He found a similarly
            shaped stone in connection with other buildings at Uxmal, and at
            other places in Yucatan.

            Still further east, at D, he found a rude, circular mound of
            rough stones. On excavating this, he was rewarded by the
            discovery of a double-headed monument. It was carved out ot a
            single block of stone. The probabilities are that it was
            purposely buried when the natives abandoned Uxmal, to prevent
            the Spaniards from destroying it. Scattered about over this
            platform were found excavations much like well-made cisterns in
            shape. As it is something of a mystery where the inhabitants
            obtained water, it is a reasonable supposition that these were
            really cisterns. Similar excavations were discovered all over
            the area of the ruins.

            Leaving the second terrace, and passing up the ruined stairway,
            we find ourselves on the summit platform of the third terrace,
            and see before us one of the long, low, richly ornamented
            buildings of Yucatan. This cut presents us an end view, but
            gives us a good idea of the building as a whole. It does not
            occupy the entire summit; there is a wide promenade all around
            it. Its length is three hundred and twenty-two feet; its width,
            thirty-nine feet, and its height twenty-six feet.

            In order to understand clearly the arrangement of the rooms, we
            will here give the ground-plan. The two end portions may have
            been additions to the original structure. There are, at any
            rate, reasons for supposing the small rooms in the two recesses
            of later construction. We must notice that we have here the
            usual three parallel walls and two rows of rooms. All the walls
            are massive, the rear wall especially so. It is nine feet thick
            throughout, and so are the transverse walls of the two recesses.
            Supposing the rear wall might contain rooms, Mr. Stephens made
            an opening through it. He found it to be solid.

            The stones facing the walls and rooms are smooth and square, and
            the mass of the masonry consists of rough, irregular fragments
            of stone and mortar. This cross-section makes this meaning
            plain. We can but notice what an immense amount of useless labor
            was bestowed on the walls and ceilings of this building.
            We gather more the idea of galleries excavated in a rocky mass,
            than of rooms inclosed by walls. The rooms are very plain;
            no attempt at decoration was observed. In one or two instances
            the remains of a fine coat of plastering was noticed.
            "The floors were of cement, in some places hard, but by long
            exposure broken, and now crumbling under foot." The arches
            supporting the roof are of the same style as those at
            Palenque--that is, triangular,--though, in this case, the ends
            of the projecting stones were beveled off so as to form a smooth
            surface. At Palenque, we remember, the inequalities were filled
            with cement. Across the arches were still to be observed beams
            of wood, the ends buried in the wall at both sides.
            The supposition is that they served to support the arches while
            building, and afterwards for the suspension of hammocks.

            There are no openings for light and ventilation, consequently
            some of the rear rooms are both damp and dark. The lintels over
            each doorway were of wood. This was the common and ordinary
            material employed for lintels in Yucatan, though in one or two
            instances stone was used. They used for this purpose beams of
            zapote, a wood noted for its strength and durability. Some inner
            lintels still remain in place. The one over the central doorway
            of the outer wall was elaborately carved, the others were plain.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The outside of the building is also of interest to us. By a
            careful examination, we notice a cornice just above the doorway.
            The wall below the cornice presents a smooth surface of
            limestone, no traces of plaster or paint appearing; above the
            cornice the facade is one solid mass of rich, complicated, and
            elaborately sculptured ornaments. This is not stucco work, as at
            Palenque, but the ornaments are carved on stone. Mr Stephens
            tells us, "Every ornament or combination is made up of separate
            stones, each of which had carved on it part of the subject, and
            was then set in its place in the wall. Each stone, by itself, is
            an unmeaning fractional portion, but placed by the side of
            others, makes, part of a whole which, without it, would
            be incomplete."

        <p class="indentedText">
            It is not possible to give a verbal description of all of the
            ornaments; we can notice but few. Over each doorway was
            represented a person apparently seated on a sort of throne,
            having a lofty head-dress, with enormous plumes of feathers
            falling symmetrically on each side. Though the figures varied in
            each case, in general characteristics they were the same as the
            one here represented, which was the figure over the central
            doorway of the building.

            Among the most commonly reappearing ornaments at Uxmal, and at
            other places, is one that has received the name of the
            "Elephant's Trunk," and has given rise to no little discussion.
            One occurs immediately above the figure. Part of this ornament
            is represented in this plate. The central part of this figure,
            which appears as a plain band, is in reality a curved projecting
            stone, which, when looked at sideways, has the appearance given
            in this cut. Though requiring a little imagination, the majority
            of travelers see in this some monster's face. The eyes and teeth
            are seen in the first engraving. This projecting stone is
            the nose.

            We stand in amazement before this sculptured facade. We must
            reflect that its builders were not possessed of metallic tools.
            It extends entirely around the building, though the end and rear
            walls are not as elaborately decorated as the front. A little
            calculation shows that it contains over ten thousand square feet
            of carved stone. The roof of the building was flat. It had been
            covered with cement. But vegetation had somehow acquired a
            foothold, and the whole is now overgrown with grass and bushes.
            Such is a brief description of this "casa." Hastening to ruins,
            it appeals powerfully to the imagination. It is a memorial of
            vanished times. We wonder what of the strange people that
            pressed up these stairs and entered these rooms? For many years
            it has been abandoned to the elements. Year by year portions of
            the ornamented facade fall. Though the walls are massive and the
            roof is strong, it is but a question of time when a low mound of
            ruins will alone mark its site.

            Like the palace at Palenque, this structure has given rise to
            conflicting theories as to its use. While many of the writers on
            this subject claim that it was the residence of royalty, there
            are, on the other hand, those who think it is simply a communal
            house of village Indians, or the official house of the tribe.
            In whatever light we shall ultimately view it, it is surely an
            interesting monument of native American culture. The labor
            necessary to rear the terraced pyramid, even though advantage
            was taken of a natural eminence, must have been great.
            The building itself, though not of great dimensions, except in
            length, must have required the labor of a large number of
            Indians for a long time. For purposes of defense, the location,
            from an Indian point of view, was an excellent one, since with
            them elevation constitutes the principal means of defense.
            The terraces could be easily ascended from but one point, where
            an enemy could be easily resisted. In a general way, it may be
            regarded as a representative of Yucatan buildings, and so we
            will be able to more rapidly describe the remaining structures.

        <p class="indentedText">
            On the general plan we see, to the north of the structure we
            have just described, a group of ruins marked "C." This is
            regarded as the most wonderful collection of edifices in
            Yucatan, and as exhibiting the highest state of ancient
            architecture and sculpture in North America. They are known as
            the "Nunnery," which we think is a very absurd name. The pyramid
            on which they stood is also terraced, though on one side only.
            We give a drawing showing the position on the summit platform of
            the four buildings forming this group. Since we have so many
            ruined structures to describe, we must avoid such details as
            will prove tiresome. We will give in a note the dimensions of
            these buildings, and of the pyramid, and pass at once to some
            points of special interest.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip"
               title='The pyramid is three hundred and fifty feet square at the base and nineteen feet high. The terraces are along the south side. The lowest terrace is three feet high and twenty feet wide. The second is twelve feet high and forty-five feet wide. The third is four feet high and five feet wide. The building on the south side is two hundred and seventy-nine feet long, twenty-eight feet wide, and eighteen feet high. The north one is two hundred and sixty-four feet long, twenty-eight feet wide, and twenty-five feet high. The eastern one, one hundred and fifty-eight feet long, thirty-five feet wide, and twenty-two feet high. The western one, one hundred and seventy-three feet long, thirty-five feet wide, and twenty feet high. (BancroftÂ´s "Native Races," Vol. IV, p. 174.) The area of the court is two hundred and fourteen feet by two hundred and fifty-eight feet. It is about two and a half feet lower than the buildings on the eastern, western, and southern sides. There are seventy-six rooms in the four ranges of buildings, and twelve more in the facings of the terrace of the north building, to be described. In size the rooms vary from twenty to thirty feet long by from ten to twelve feet wide.'>[47]</a>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Traces of stairways are mentioned as leading up to the terrace,
            but none of the steps remained in place. The southern building
            is seen to have doors in both the court and terrace walls, but
            in this case the middle wall is unbroken. All the rooms of this
            building are single. In the plan it appears divided into two
            buildings; the opening is, however, but a triangular arched
            doorway, through which access was had to the court.

            There is no one to dispute our right of way, and so, climbing up
            the ruined stairs, and passing through the deserted gateway, we
            emerge into a courtyard, now silent and deserted and overgrown
            with bushes and grass. It was once paved and covered with
            cement, and in the center are the remains of a stone pillar,
            similar to that in front of the governor's house. When the
            houses were all occupied this court must have presented an
            animated scene. But, now that the buildings are tenantless and
            going to ruin, it must impress all beholders with a sense of the
            changes wrought by time.

            It will be noticed that the northern building does not stand in
            quite the same direction as the southern one, which detracts
            from the symmetry of the whole. It stands on a fourth terrace,
            twenty feet higher than the others. A grand, but ruined,
            staircase leads up the center of the terrace. At each end of
            this staircase built against the terrace, could be distinguished
            the ruins of a small building. There is one unusual feature
            about the ruins in the eastern building. In general, only two
            rooms open into each other. In this building, however, six rooms
            form one suite, and, furthermore, all the doorways of this suite
            are decorated with sculpture. As this suite of rooms was
            evidently a place of interest, we will introduce this
            illustration, which gives us a good idea of the appearance of
            the rooms on the inside. We would do well to compare this cut
            with that of the room in Pueblo Bonito (Chapter XI). The arched
            roof is not a true arch but simply the triangular arch we have
            already spoken of.

            The principal attraction about these buildings is the beautiful
            facades which overlook the court-yard. They are pronounced by
            all to be the finest examples of native American art. With one
            exception, they are neither complicated nor grotesque, but
            chaste and artistic. As in the Governor's House, the part below
            the cornice is plain, but the remaining part, both front and
            rear, is covered with sculpture. On entering the court-yard from
            the arched gateway of the southern building, we notice that its
            facade is composed of diamond lattice-work and vertical columns,
            while over each doorway is something that resembles a house,
            with a human figure seated in a doorway. This cut represents but
            a small portion of this facade, but it gives us an idea of
            the whole.

            The facade of the eastern building was in the best state of
            preservation of any. We give a section of this also.
            The ornaments over the doorway, shown in the cut, consist of
            three of those mysterious masks, with the projecting curved
            stone, already described. "The ornaments over the other doorways
            are less striking, more simple, and more pleasing. In all of
            them there is, in the center, a masked face, with the tongue
            hanging out, surmounted by an elaborate head-dress. Between the
            horizontal bars is a range of diamond-shaped ornaments, in which
            the remains of red paint are still distinctly visible, and at
            each end of these bars is a serpent's head, with the mouth wide
            open." It is necessary to examine the drawing attentively, to
            distinguish these features. Some think the masked face
            represents the sun.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The western facade is known as the Serpent Facade. It was very
            much in ruins at the time of Mr. Stephens's visit. When entire,
            it must have been of great beauty. Two serpents are trailed
            along the whole front, and by the interlacing of their bodies
            divide the surface into square panels. In the open mouth of
            these serpents is sculptured a human head. The panels are filled
            with ornaments similar in design to those of the "Governor's
            House," and among the ornaments of each panel are found one or
            more human faces, while full-sized figures are not entirely
            absent. This cut represents but a small portion of the facade.
            It gives us, however, an idea of the whole. We notice, over the
            doorway again, the elephant's trunk ornament.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The northern building, standing high above the rest, on its own
            terrace, was doubtless intended to have the grandest front of
            all. It was, however, in such a ruined state, and the few
            remaining fragments so complicated, that no drawings have been
            given us. Human figures are represented in several places; two
            are apparently playing on musical instruments. We recall that at
            Palenque, the roof of some of the temples bears a curious
            two-storied work, erected apparently for ornamental purposes.
            The same instinct reappears in this building. At regular
            intervals along the front they carried the wall above the
            cornice, forming thirteen turret-like elevations ten feet wide,
            and seventeen feet high. These turrets were also loaded with
            ornaments. Another curious feature about this building is, that
            it was erected over, and completely inclosed, a smaller building
            of an older date. Wherever the outer walls have fallen, the
            ornamented cornice of the inner building is visible.

        <p class="indentedText">
            When we reflect on the patient labor that must have been
            expended on this pyramid and these buildings, we are filled with
            admiration for their perseverance and ingenuity. They had
            neither domestic animals or metallic tools. The buildings were
            massively built and richly ornamented. The sculptured portion
            covers over twenty-four thousand square feet.

            The terraced
            mound supporting the house contained over sixty thousand cubic
            yards of materials, though this may not be wholly artificial.
            To our eyes, as these rooms had neither windows nor fire-places,
            they are not very desirable. But we may be sure that the
            builders considered them as models of their kind.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Leaving this interesting ruin, we will now visit one of the
            temples. This is east of the Nunnery, and is marked "D" on the
            plan. The mound on which this building stands is high enough to
            overlook the entire field of ruins. This cut represents the
            eastern side of the mound, up which a flight of stone steps lead
            to the building on the summit. There are some grounds for
            supposing a grander staircase, supported on triangular arches,
            led up the western side.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The building on the top is not large--only seventy-two feet
            long, and twelve feet wide--and consists of but three rooms,
            none opening into each other. The front of the building, though
            much ruined, presented an elegant and tasteful appearance.
            There seems to be no doubt that this temple was the scene of
            idolatrous worship; perhaps of human sacrifices. In a legal
            paper which Mr. Stephens saw at Meridia, containing a grant of
            the lands on which these ruins stand, bearing date 1673, it is
            expressly stated that the Indians at that time had idols in
            these ancient buildings, to which, every day, openly and
            publicly, they burned copal. Nor is there any doubt that this
            was the continuation of an old custom. In the end room of this
            temple are engraved two circular figures which, by some, are
            considered as proofs of the presence of Phallic worship.

            The buildings we have described will give us a very good idea of
            the structures of this ancient city. We have described but a few
            of them, but we have now only space to make some general
            observations. We wish to point out some resemblances to the
            ruins at Palenque. In both, buildings that served as temples
            were not large, but of small dimensions, and contained but few
            rooms. They occupy the summits of high pyramids. Such was
            probably the building on the summit of the pyramid at "F" (see
            plan). The buildings on the top of this pyramid, like that just
            described, had but three rooms. A very large pyramid is seen at
            "E." Our information in regard to it is very meager. A square
            platform was found on the summit. It is not unreasonable to
            suppose that this platform was intended to support a temple.
            But, before it was erected, the presence of the Spaniards put an
            end to all native building. There are, however, no proofs to be
            advanced in support of this statement; it is a mere suggestion.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            We think the House of the Nuns illustrates the general plan of
            building employed at both places. That is as follows: They first
            erected a rectangular pyramid or mounds often terraced.
            Buildings were then put up parallel to the four sides, thus
            inclosing a court. At Palenque this court, as we have seen, was
            built over. Besides the House of Nuns, there are several other
            instances at Uxmal of courts with buildings on their sides.
            Looking at the plan, we see one at "G," and a still more ruined
            one between that and "F." Such a court, with traces of ruined
            buildings, also exists between the nunnery and the temple, at
            "D." It is not improbable that groups of low ruins existing to
            the westward of the structures described would be found, on
            examination, to reveal the same arrangements.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            As for the grand terraced pyramid supporting the Governor's
            House, it may well be that other buildings would have been added
            in process of time, as population increased. It is not necessary
            to suppose they erected all the buildings around a court at
            once. It seems very reasonable to suppose the northern building
            of the House of Nuns the oldest. The direction is not quite the
            same as the others; it stands on a higher terrace; and,
            furthermore, the present exterior walls are simply built around
            the older building. It may be, however, that the great terraced
            mound of the Governor's House was intended to support but one
            building. As there is the best of reason for supposing that
            Uxmal was inhabited at the time of the conquest, there is
            nothing to forbid the conclusion that the erection of pyramids,
            temples, and buildings was still going on.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Hieroglyphics, which formed such an interesting feature at
            Palenque, are here almost entirely wanting. A few rows occur
            around the head of the figure over the principal doorway of the
            Governor's House. They are of the same general character as
            those already described, but are "more rich, elaborate, and
            complicated." As to the probable antiquity of these ruins, we
            must defer consideration until we become more acquainted with
            the ruins of Yucatan.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The places we have now described will make us acquainted with
            the general character of the ruins scattered all over Yucatan.
            We do not feel as if we would be justified in dwelling at any
            great length over the remainder, though one or two important
            places must be mentioned. A word as to the frequency with which
            the ruins occur. We want to repeat that Yucatan, even to this
            day, is far from being thoroughly explored. Almost our only
            source of information is the writings of Mr. Stephens. But he
            only described a few places. In a trip of thirty-nine miles he
            took in a westerly direction from Uxmal he saw no less than
            seven different groups of ruins. Some of these, though in a very
            dilapidated state, presented points of great interest. When he
            started he knew of but few of those ruins. Some he heard of
            quite by accident while on his way, and some he first saw as he
            journeyed along the road. We must suppose the whole country
            equally well supplied.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            After he had left Uxmal for good, at the village of Nochahab
            (see map), a little inquiry brought him information of so many
            ruins that he did not have time to visit them all. As to the
            question of use to which these buildings were applied, we must
            either suppose they had an immense number of temples and
            palaces--one or the other every few miles--or else they were the
            residences of the people themselves. And, though it may seem
            very strange that an imperfectly developed people should
            ornament so profusely and delicately their ordinary places of
            abode,
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='See "Proceedings Am. Antiq. Society," April, 1880, p. 57.'>[50]</a>
            yet it is difficult to understand why they should
            rear such an abundance of temples and palaces.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At Kabah (see map) Mr. Stephens found a most interesting field
            of ruins, rivaling Uxmal in extent, if not surpassing it.
            One group of buildings, arranged much like the House of Nuns,
            has some interesting features about it. The highest terrace in
            this case is nearly square, and the building on its summit is
            nearly the same shape. We have here two rows of double rooms,
            separated by a middle wall, very massive, as if two of the
            typical Maya buildings had been placed back to back. The front
            of this building was elaborately ornamented. In all the
            buildings at Uxmal the part above the cornice only was
            ornamented. Here the entire front was covered with carved stone.
            To make room for further ornaments the roof bore an additional
            appendage, like the second story of the Palenque temples.
            This building must have presented a wonderful appearance
            when entire.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Another feature at this place has reference to the pyramid.
            We are familiar with the idea of a terraced mound supporting
            buildings. In one of these Kabah structures the buildings are
            arranged in a different and suggestive way. That is, the pyramid
            was terraced off. There were three ranges of buildings, the roof
            of one range forming a promenade in front of the other.
            In another of the Kabah structures was found a wooden lintel,
            elegantly carved. Mr. Stephens tells us the lines were clear and
            distinct, and the cutting, under any test, and without any
            reference to the people by whom it was executed, would be
            considered as indicating great skill and proficiency in the art
            of carving on wood. At the expense of a great deal of hard work,
            he succeeded in getting this lintel out and removed to New York,
            where it was unfortunately destroyed by fire.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            They worked stone to better advantage at Kabah than at Uxmal.
            For the first time we meet with lintels of stone and a doorway
            with carved jambs. The lintels were supported in the center by a
            pillar. The pillars were rude and unpolished, but they were not
            out of proportion, and, in fact, were adapted to the lowness of
            the building. We will only mention one more structure. This is a
            lonely arch, of the same form as all the rest, having a span of
            fourteen feet. It stands on a ruined mound, disconnected from
            every other structure, in solitary grandeur. "Darkness rests
            upon its history, but in that desolation and solitude, among the
            ruins around, it stood like the proud memorial of a Roman
            triumph." There was the usual pyramid with a temple. In a plan
            given of the field of ruins seventeen groups are seen, and,
            withont a doubt, many more exist in the immediate forest.

            M. Charney has of late years made a discovery which conclusively
            shows that this was an inhabited place at the time of the
            conquest. In a room as ruined as the rest he discovered the
            stueeo'figure of a horse and its rider. They are formed after
            the Indian manner by an inexperienced hand guided by an
            over-excited imagination. Both figures are easily recognized.
            The horse has on its trappings. We can see the stirrups. The man
            wears his cuirass. We all know what astonishment the appearance
            of men on horseback produced among the Indians, and so we are
            not at a loss to divine the cause which led to the construction
            of this figure. We must remember Mr. Stephens was hurried for
            time. Portions of this figure were mutilated, and other portions
            had been covered over by a layer of stucco, which Charney had to
            remove before the figure could be distinctly made out.

            Within a radius of ten miles from Kabah are located no less than
            six so-called cities. The general appearance of all is the
            same--low ranges of buildings on terraced mounds, and ornamented
            facades. One of these places, by the name of Zayi, is of
            interest to us, because it gives us a hint as to how these
            people constructed their buildings. Amongst other buildings they
            found one large terraced mound, with buildings arranged on it in
            a very significant manner. There were three ranges of
            buildings, one over the other--the roof of one range on a level
            with the foundation of the range above. A grand stair-way led up
            the mound. This feature is illustrated in the plate opposite.
            We can imagine what a grand appearance must have been presented
            by this great terraced mound, when its buildings were
            all perfect.

            The plan of this mound and buildings is shown in the last cut.
            Ten rooms on the north side of the second range presented a
            curious feature. They were all filled up with a solid mass of
            stone and mortar, and this filling up must have gone on as fast
            as the walls rose, and the arched ceiling must have closed over
            a solid mass. A very reasonable explanation is given of this
            state of things by Mr. Morgan.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='"Contributions to North American Ethnology," Vol. IV, p. 267.'>[52]</a>
            He considers that such was
            the rudeness of mechanical knowledge among these people that the
            only way they could construct their peculiar arched roof was to
            build it over an internal core of masonry. Once put together
            over such a core, and carried up several feet, the down weight
            of the arch would articulate and hold the mass together.
            Then the core of masonry would be cleaned out, and the room was
            ready for use. If this be true, it follows that these rooms were
            the last erected. They were not yet cleared out when the
            operations of the Spaniards put an end to all native building.
            We must notice the structures at Zayi are in as ruined a
            condition as the others--thus strengthening the conviction that
            their abandonment was at about the time of the conquest of
            the peninsula.

        <p class="indentedText">
            We have not space to follow Mr. Stephens in all his journey.
            Every few miles he came across one of these peculiar structures.
            A common design is apparent in all; but all are alike enveloped
            in mystery. At Labna he found an extensive field of ruins, equal
            in importance to any in Yucatan. The next illustration
            represents an arched gateway, which reminds us of that in the
            "House of Nuns." Passing through this he found himself in a
            ruined court-yard, fronting which were the remains of buildings;
            but this was only one of many groups of ruins, and Labna was but
            one of many places visited. At Labphak Mr. Stephens found "the
            tottering remains of the grandest structure that now rears its
            ruined head in the forests of Yucatan." This was a terraced
            mound, faced by buildings on three sides, leaving an immense
            stair-way occupying the fourth side.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Small interior stair-ways are mentioned in this building, but no
            particular description is given of them. At two places
            sculptured tablets were found. These tablets are worthy of
            notice. They were the only ones Mr. Stephens found, except at
            Palenque. It will be seen, on the map, that this ruin is nearer
            Palenque than any of the places in Yucatan yet described.
            Stucco ornaments, so apparent at the latter place, were now
            becoming numerous again. At Uxmal stone for building could be
            had in the greatest abundance--it was not as plenty here.
            The builders, apparently, adapted their ornamentation to the
            material at hand; and, while at Palenque they employed stucco in
            ornament, at Uxmal they carved stone.

        <p class="indentedText">
            We must now leave this interesting section of Yucatan, though
            only a few places have been mentioned. The reader is well aware
            of the difference of opinion with which these ruins are viewed.
            Some of them are unquestionably temples. If we regard the others
            as palaces and the public buildings of great cities, we are at
            once puzzled to account for their great numbers. If we look on
            the majority of them as communal residences of the inhabitants,
            we are amazed at the mass of decorations with which they are
            adorned. But our admiration stops there--we are accustomed to
            speak of them as stately edifices. This is owing to their
            exterior ornaments, and their position on terraced mounds.
            The houses are often of great length, but not striking in other
            regards. The rooms, in the majority of cases, are small, low,
            dark, and ill ventilated. A great amount of useless labor was
            bestowed upon the walls, which were unnecessarily massive.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Near the center of the northern part of the peninsula is seen a
            place marked Chichen, to which is generally added the word Itza,
            making the entire name of the place Chichen-Itza. In this case
            the ancient Maya name has come down to us with the
            ruins--Chichen meaning the "mouth of wells," having reference to
            two springs which supplied the place with water. Itza is the
            name of a branch of the Maya people. This place is of interest
            to us in several ways. It was, unquestionably, a renowned city
            in aboriginal times. Here the Spaniards met with a very severe
            repulse. As a ruin it attracted the attention of early writers,
            and it has been the subject of antiquarian research in recent
            times. The description of the buildings will not detain us long.
            They are, evidently, the work of the same people as those whose
            structures we have already described.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            One of the most important buildings is known as the Nunnery,
            reminding us at once of the collection of buildings of that name
            at Uxmal. In this case, however, the pyramid is represented by a
            solid mass of masonry one hundred and twelve by one hundred and
            sixty feet, rising with perpendicular sides to the height of
            thirty-two feet. This is seen to be a departure from the method
            of constructing pyramids hitherto described. The proprietor of
            the estate on whose grounds these ruins are located used this
            mound as a stone-quarry. An excavation of thirty feet revealed
            no secret chambers.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The probabilities are that it is solid throughout. A grand
            staircase, fifty-six feet wide, leads up to the top of this
            mound. Mr. Stephens tells us that three ranges of buildings
            occupied the summit, and his drawings represent the same.
            The roof of the one forms a promenade in front of the one above.
            So each range of buildings rests on a foundation solid from the
            ground. Mr. Bancroft describes this mound as having but two
            ranges of buildings on the summit. Of these buildings the second
            range was, seemingly, the most important. Several of its rooms
            contained niches in the back wall, extending from floor to
            ceiling. From traces still visible, they were once covered with
            painted ornaments. One of the rooms was fifty-seven feet long
            and nine wide.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In the rear wall of this room were nine of these niches. "All of
            the walls of this room, from the floor to the peak of the arch,
            had been covered with painted designs, now wantonly defaced, but
            the remains of which present colors, in some places, still
            bright and vivid; and among these remains detached portions of
            human figures continually reappear, well drawn, the heads
            adorned with plumes of feathers and the hands bearing shields
            and spears." To this pile of masonry, at one end, a wing had
            been attached. This building was similar in design to other
            buildings in Yucatan. Theoretically we would expect this wing to
            be much later in time than the buildings on the mound. That it
            is so, is proven by the fact that in two rooms the internal core
            of masonry, as described at Zayi, had not been wholly removed.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            We have noticed in all these structures, the builders first
            threw up a mound or pyramid to support the building. In one of
            the Chichen edifices the earth had been excavated from all
            around it, so as to still present the appearance of a mound.
            Perhaps the most prominent object at this place is a stately
            pyramid, with an imposing building, represented in the plate
            opposite. The mound itself is nearly two hundred feet square,
            and rises to the height of seventy-five feet. On the west and
            north sides are ruined staircases.

            On the ground, at the foot of the stairway on the north side,
            "forming a bold, striking, and well conceive commencement to
            this lofty range, are two colossal serpents' heads, ten feet in
            length, with mouths wide open, and tongues protruding. No doubt
            they were emblematic of some religious belief, and, in the mind
            of an imaginative people passing between them, to ascend the
            steps, must have excited feelings of solemn awe." The temple on
            the summit of this pyramid has some peculiar features about it.
            It is nearly square--forty-three by forty-nine feet--only one
            door in each side. In the room within, instead of partition
            walls supporting arches, were two immense beams, resting on
            square pillars, and supporting two arches--the only instance in
            the ruins of Yucatan of such use of beams.

            walls. On the plan of Uxmal they are noticed between the

            represents this feature. These walls are each two hundred and
            seventy-four feet long, thirty feet thick, and twenty-six feet
            high. The distance separating them is one hundred and twenty
            feet. About one hundred feet from the north end, is seen a
            building fronting the open space between the walls. A building
            stood in a like position at the south end. In the cut a stone
            ring is seen projecting from each side. On the rim and border of
            these rings were sculptured two serpents, represented below.
            The general supposition is that this structure was used in the
            celebration of public games. Mr. Stephens refers us to the
            writings of Herrera, an early historian, for a description of a
            game of ball played at Mexico, where the surroundings must have
            been much the same as is here represented.

            Most of the structures in Yucatan have been left in undisturbed
            quiet since the visit of Mr. Stephens. Five years after his
            visit, the Indians rose in revolt, and a large portion of
            country through which he traveled in perfect safety has, since
            then, been shunned by cautious travelers. As he says, "For a
            brief space the stillness that reigned around them was broken,
            and they were again left to solitude and silence." At Uxmal, and
            some places near the coast, more recent travelers have
            investigated the ruins, wondered over them, and passed on,
            without materially adding to our knowledge respecting them.
            In 1873 a French scientists Dr. A. Le Plongon, accompanied by
            his wife, visited Yucatan for the purpose of exploring the
            ruins. They spent a year in Meridia, thoroughly studying the
            customs of the country, and preparing for work.

            Their first field of work was this ancient city, Chichen-Itza.
            As a result, he lays before us a picture of life and times not
            only vastly remote from us, but surpassing in wonder any thing
            hitherto presented. In the field of American antiquities we need
            scarcely be surprised at whatever conclusions are presented to
            us. We believe, however, we are not too harsh in saying that
            scholars, as a rule, consider Le Plongon as too much carried
            away by enthusiasm to judge coolly of his discoveries.

            The most important part of his discoveries seem to have been in
            the buildings in connection with the Gymnasium last described.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At the time of the Spanish conquest, a very common tradition
            among the natives was that, in ancient times, three brothers
            governed the country. This legend of three rulers in olden
            times, was not peculiar to the Mayas, but was found among all
            the Indian nations of Central America.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='"Proceedings Am. Antiq. Society," Oct., 1878, p. 73.'>[55]</a>
            In our opinion this
            last statement at once shows we have here to deal with a
            question belonging to mythology and not to history. But M. Le
            Plongon considers the buildings at Chichen, especially those of
            the Gymnasium, illustrative of the lives of the three brothers,
            and of the queen of one of them. In brief, he tells us the names
            of these three brothers were, Chaac-mol, Huuncay, and Aac.
            The first of these, Chaac-mol, means Tiger King. It was he who
            raised Chichen-Itza to the height of its glory. M. Le Plongon
            would have us believe that the merchants of Asia and Africa
            traded in its marts, and that the wise men of the world came
            hither to consult with the H-men,
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='Learned men of the Mayas.'>[56]</a>
            whose convent, together
            with their astronomical laboratory, is still to be seen. Aac was
            the younger brother of the three. He conspired against the life
            of Chaac-mol, and finally killed him. The queen of Chaac-mol
            then erected the buildings around the Gymnasium as his memorial.

            At the south end of the eastern wall Mr. Stephens noticed two
            ruined buildings, an upper and a lower one, of which our next
            cut is a representation. He was struck with the remains of
            painting, which entirely covered the walls. He tells us the
            walls were everywhere covered with designs in painting,
            representing, in bright and vivid colors, human figures,
            battles, houses, trees, and scenes of domestic life. We give, in
            a plate, detached portions of these figures. We must understand
            that, in the original, these were beautifully colored.
            The colors used were "green, yellow, red, blue, and reddish
            brown, the last being invariably the color given to
            human flesh."

        <p class="indentedText">
            M. Le Plongon contends that these paintings represent scenes in
            the lives of the three brothers and the Queen of Chaac-mol, "in
            the funeral chamber." Says he: "The terrible altercation between
            Aac and Chaac-mol, which had its termination in the murder of
            the latter by his brother, is represented by large figures
            three-fourths life size."
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='American Antiquarian Society, October 1878.'>[57]</a>
            And in another place he tells us:
            "The scenes of his death is impressively portrayed on the walls,
            which the queen caused to be raised to the memory of her
            husband, in the two exquisite rooms, the ruins of which are yet
            to be seen upon the south end of the east wall of the Gymnasium.
            The rooms were a shrine where the conjugal love of the queen
            worshiped the memory of her departed lover. She adorned the
            outer walls with his effigies, his totem-tiger, and his shield
            and coat-of-arms between tiger and tiger;
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='The tigers can be seen on the engraving of the gymnasium.'>[58]</a>
            whilst on the
            admirably polished stucco, that covers the stones in the
            interior of the rooms, she had his deeds--his and her own life,
            in fact--painted in beautiful, life-like designs, superbly
            drawn, and sweetly colored."
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='Proceedings American Antiquarian Society, April, 1877, p. 97.'>[59]</a>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            He tells us further, that Aac, after the commission of his
            crime, fled to Uxmal for protection, where he built the edifice
            described as the "Governor's House." The seated figures over the
            central door-way (see Illustration of Figure over Doorway,
            earlier), he says, represents Aac. In the hieroglyphics around
            the head he finds the name. Although neither Mr. Stephens nor
            the other travelers mention any thing of the kind, he says that,
            under the feet of this figure, "are to be seen the bodies of
            three figures, two men and one woman, flayed."
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='Proceedings American Antiquarian Society, April, 1877, p. 101.'>[60]</a>
            Though the
            figures are headless, he has no doubt but that they represent
            Huuncay, Chaae-Mol, and the queen, his wife. We are further told
            that the ruined structure on the second terrace, called the
            "House of Turtles," was Aac's private residence.

            This wonderful story of the lives and adventures of the three
            brothers was revealed to the doctor by a careful study of the
            detached painting mentioned by Mr. Stephens. One of the
            paintings which served him so good a turn is shown in the cut
            above, which he considers represents the queen, when a child,
            consulting one of the wise men as to her future destiny.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='M. Le Plongon interprets the curved figures issuing from the throat of the wise-man.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Perhaps as interesting a portion of his discoveries as any, is
            finding sculptured figures of bearded white men on the pillars
            of the temple, and painted on the walls of Chaac-mol's chambers.
            He thinks they have Assyrian features. He also claims to have
            discovered figures having true Negro features.

        <p class="indentedText">
            As to the antiquity of this city he readily figures up nineteen
            thousand years; but this did not take him to the beginning.
            He arrives at this estimate in this way: To the north-east of
            the pyramid, we have described, are to be seen rows of small
            columns, which have excited the curiosity of all who have seen
            them. Mr. Stephens represents them in four rows, inclosing a
            rectangular area. M. Le Plongon says they surrounded three sides
            of a terraced pyramid, which once supported the main temple of
            the city. Mr. Stephens has no suggestions to offer as to
            their use.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Le Plongon claims they were used to measure time, and quotes
            from old authors to the effect, that each stone in them stands
            for twenty years; and, as there is always just eight stones in a
            column, each column means one hundred and sixty years.
            He counted one hundred and twenty of these columns--and then, as
            he says: "Got tired of pushing my way through the nearly
            impenetrable thicket, where I could see many more among the
            shrubs." From this number he computes nineteen thousand two
            hundred years.

        <p class="indentedText">
            What shall we say to this story that M. Le Plongon brings us of
            ancient Maya civilization? It is unquestioned that he has
            expended a great amount of patient labor in his work, has braved
            many dangers, and is thoroughly in earnest. He has also spent
            years in the field, and ought to be well qualified to judge of
            the ruins. We believe, however, he is altogether wrong in his
            conclusions. The keystone of his discoveries--the one on which
            he relies to prove the accuracy of his methods--fails him.
            This was the discovery of the statue of Chaac-mol himself, which
            is here represented. He claims to have found it as the result of
            successfully rendering certain mural tablets in the funeral
            chamber, but a careful reading of his own account of the affair
            leaves us under the impression that the "instincts of the
            archaeologist" had as much to do with it as any thing else.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Be that as it may, he certainly did find this statue buried in
            the ground. He is very positive it is Chaac-mol, claiming to
            have read the name readily in hieroglyphics on the ear-tablets.
            He says: "It is not an idol, but a true portrait of a man who
            has lived an earthly life. I have seen him represented in
            battle, in council, and in court receptions. I am well
            acquainted with his life, and the manner of his death."
            This statue was seized by the Mexican Government, and taken to
            Mexico. Here a curious discovery was made. Another statue
            similar to this was already in the museum. This latter had been
            found not far from Mexico. Since then, still a third, smaller
            than the others, but evidently representing the same personage,
            has been discovered. In short, it has been shown that this is an
            idol, worshiped as well by the Aztecs as by the Mayas, and,
            instead of being buried, as Le Plongon asserts, five thousand
            years ago, we have not much doubt it was buried to prevent its
            falling in to the hands of the Spaniards.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='North American Review, October, 1880. And yet there are indications that this is a statue. See BandelierÂ´s "ArchÃ¦ological Tour in Mexico," p. 74.'>[63]</a>

        <p class="indentedText">
            As to the antiquity with which Le Plongon would clothe Chichen,
            if his method be right, he has not more than made a beginning.
            Mr. Stephens counted three hundred and eighty of these same
            columns, and tells us there were many more.
            <a href="#" name="tooltip" title='StephensÂ´s "Yucatan," Vol. II, p. 318.'>[64]</a>
            We know no good
            reason for supposing Chichen was not inhabited at the time of
            the conquest. The wooden beams and lintels in the temples have
            not yet decayed, and the masonry had not been cleaned out of
            some of the rooms. On this point we wish to make a suggestion, a
            mere hint. The pillars that supported the arches in the temple
            mentioned some pages back were covered with sculpture.
            Amongst some others, but very faintly represented, was the
            preceding figure of a bearded man. May it not be that it
            represents a Spaniard? We must recall the stucco figure of the
            horse and its rider at Kabah. It seems to us a reasonable
            suggestion that they should carve on the pillars of their
            temples representations of the Spaniards, for the Spaniards were
            twenty-five years in gaining a permanent foothold in Yucatan,
            and during that time the Indians would continue to build and
            ornament as before.
