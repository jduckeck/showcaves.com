        <br clear="all">

        <p>
            <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span> is a website with information
            about numerous tourist underground sites.
            It seemed weird to us, to make a FAQ for this complex site, since we expected,
            there would be a big variety in the questions asked.
            But reality is different: many visitors make similar misapprehensions which
            results in a constant flow of similar enquiries.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            People who found one of our pages with a search engine think the page is the
            whole site.
            They assume it to be the page of somebody related to the cave or mine, the owner
            or administrator.
            So they erroneously ask us questions, they should ask the respective site
            administrator.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            So now, receiving this mail, which is not intended for us, we have two
            possibilities:
            we ignore the questions, (which may be annoying for the enquirer, who gets no
            respones) or we tell the enquirer that we are not the right place and were he
            should go instead.
            Until now we exercised possibility two.
            Increasing traffic made this a Sisyphean work and only one in thousand people we
            helped was polite enough to reply a simple <i>thank you</i>.
            Numerous insults made it annoying too.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            So please understand, that <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span> will
            not answer any inquiry of this kind.
            This FAQ explains why and how to get information on your own.

        <h2><a name="1">FAQ 1:</a> Can you give me detailed information about....?</h2>


        <p>
            Unfortunately there are many inquiries about things, we already described in the
            respective page.
            <b class="smallCaps">Spock</b> of Star Treck, being absolutely logical, would
            suppose the questioner being either illiterate or lazy.
            The logical conclusion is: if the person is illiterate, he will not be able to
            read my answer.
            If he is lazy, he will be too lazy to read my answer.
            In both cases it is useless to write an answer.
            And who am I to question Spocks analysis?
            <img class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Smile.png" alt="Smile">
        </p>

        <p>
            If our pages are not detailed enough, there are several things <b>YOU</b> can do:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Follow the links at the bottom of the page to visit the other web pages about the cave.</li>
            <li>Start a search about the cave's name on a search engine
                (e.g. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/"><img class="ui-li-icon ui-corner-none symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/World.png" alt="World">Google</a>).
            </li>
            <li>Use the address of the cave and call, fax or write them directly.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            After you found more info, or visited the cave, please send the info to us!
            There is an <a href="SubmitInfo.html">explanation, how to submit info</a>.
            We can not visit all caves on the world ourselves, so this will help improve this service.
        </p>


        <br>
        <h2><a name="2">FAQ 2:</a> I want to book a visit for....</h2>

        <p>
            <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span> is a website about underground tourist destinations all over the world.
            We do <b>not</b> offer any kind of booking service.
            Asking us to book a tour is like asking <b>Lonely Planet</b> or <b>Frommer's</b>.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            <b>Please contact the administration directly!</b>
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            The address is given in the address field of the <a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../Info/index.html"><b>useful information</b></a> section.
            If it is not there, we do not know it, and any further email request is futile!
        </p>


        <br>
        <h2><a name="3">FAQ 3:</a> Please send me a brochure, a map,...</h2>

        <p>
            <b>No, I will not send anything.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Maybe you are under the same misapprehension as described in FAQ 2.
            This is a website about numerous show caves and mines, and we are <b>not</b> the
            ones to send you anything.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            We will definitely never send anything by snail mail or call you back at the
            telephone.
            And we will not send anything by e-mail.
            If we get new info or images, we will update the respective page or create a new
            one.
        </p>


        <br>
        <h2><a name="4">FAQ 4:</a> Your information was wrong so I travelled hundreds of kilometers for nothing!</h2>

        <p>
            We are really sorry for that, and we will update our page as soon as possible.
            But:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Although every effort has been made to ensure that the information provided
                is correct, we can <b>not</b> guarantee its accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>Any use of the information provided here, is on your own risk.
                We will not be liable for any damage that occurs in connection with your use of this service.
            </li>
            <li>If you just want to complain, please send all complaints to
                <img onClick="xemhid('complaints','showcaves','com')" src="../../../xemhid.php?p1=complaints&p2=showcaves&p3=com" class="xemhid" alt="contact">.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <br>
        <h2><a name="5">FAQ 5:</a> The link does not work! The link points to a sex site! The entrance fee changed!</h2>

        <p>
            This kind of information is always welcome and we will update the respective
            pages asap.
            Unfortunately many of those messages, though made with best intentions, are
            absolutely worthless.
            That is rather annoying and a waste of time for both of us.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>To change our page we need the <b>address of the page</b>.
                This site has 5000 pages, and often the message contains not enough info to
                find the page you meant.
            </li>

            <li>Then we need <b>sufficient information</b>.
                Tell us the new location of the link, or the new entrance fees, open hours
                etc.
                To tell us, that something is wrong, without any chance to make it right, is
                frustrating!
                Please ponder yourself if the info you give us is sufficient to update the
                page.
            </li>

            <li>A serious problem are links mutating from cave links to sex site links.
                This happens from time to time, if a hosting service - which hosted the cave
                page - crashes and the domain is bought by a sex site owner.
                Unfortunately the comments we get about those links are rather annoying:
                they are rude, aggressive and insulting.
                And of course, they are anonymous!
                <br>
                <b>Like anybody else, we do not like being insulted, so just tell us the url of the link without offending us and we will remove it.</b>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h2><a name="6">FAQ 6:</a> please send me the location of caves, that I can go climbing/collect minerals/go diving....</h2>

        <p>
            All caves on earth are unique and extremely fragile wonders of nature, home to
            extremely rare and delicate life.
            They needed geological periods of time to form, and are destroyed in seconds.
            Most caves are protected by the law of the respective country, the others should
            be.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Do you really think we will give any information to somebody we do not know
                on the web?</b>
        </p>


        <br>
        <h2><a name="7">FAQ 7:</a> I am the owner of this cave and you write things I do not like, remove them!</h2>

        <p>
            <b>This site is independent from the commercial owners of caves and mines.</b>
            So the content is not a commercial or advertisement, but an objective
            description of the situation.
            We are doing our best to keep them as neutral as possible.
            But of course, the descriptions represents the personal opinion of the author.
            The right to write ones opinion is protected by laws of free speech in all free
            countries of the world.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            So if something is <b>wrong</b>, tell us how it really is, explain it to us, and
            we will change it.
            But if you think, our description is not enthusiastic enough, or feel snubbed,
            please send your comment to

        <br>
        <h2><a name="8">FAQ 8:</a> The Map of country XYZ is not clickable at all!</h2>

        <p>
            That is our fault!
            We are working on it, but it is so much work, and it is impossible to have it
            all done at once!
            <b>We are very sorry, but it will take some time to complete them one after
                another.</b>
        </p>


        <br>
        <h2><a name="9">FAQ 9:</a> I have to do a school project about caves, can you explain me what a cave is?</h2>

        <p>
            <b>No, we will not do your homework for you!</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Our pages contain many explanations about caves, speleothems and much more.
            Then there are links to other resources, including informations for teachers and
            pages dedicated to the American school projects....
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            So please help yourself!
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            But if your question is more specific, and we think there might be other people
            interested in this, we will write a new page about this topic or improve an
            existing page.
            Of course, we will send you the link.
        </p>


        <br>
        <h2><a name="10">FAQ 10:</a> Can you recommend a hotel? Wanna buy some limestone? Can you tell me about the weather? My relatives lived at this place 200 years ago, do you know my family?</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Mails which are not related to the topic of this site (you remember, caves
                and mines) will be considered spam and ignored.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            We are sorry for that, but we are not able to spend so much time for unrelated
            enquiries.
        </p>


        <br>
        <h2><a name="11">FAQ 11:</a> How about some link exchange?</h2>

        <p>
            <b>No!</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you very much for any informative link you provide us.
            If your page contains cave related information we will link it at an appropriate
            point of the site.
            It is not necessary, that you link back to our site.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>But we will not link to any other page, just because that page links to
                <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span>.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            The reason is very simple: random links and link exchanges increase the "lost in
            cyberspace" phenomenon.
            A link is only useful, if the user is led to a page about a topic he is
            interested in.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            We know many page owners try to increase their Google ranking by placing links
            to their own site on other websites.

        <h2><a name="12">FAQ 12:</a> Pour mozele da esli deuxi&egrave;me polutschisch notres smenite i vacances d'été go znameto quinzaine to poswoni...</h2>

        <p>
            Pardon?
        </p>

        <p>
            We only speak Schwäbisch, German and English.
            But if you are able to read my pages, which are written in English, you should
            also be able to ask your question in English too.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            To be honest, it is pretty impolite of you, not to do so the first time.
            It is always wise to contact people on the web in the language their pages are
            written in.
            We would answer anyway, but that is impossible if we do not understand the
            question.
