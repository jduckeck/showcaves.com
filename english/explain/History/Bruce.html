        <p>
            The story about <b>Robert the Bruce</b>, the cave and the spider is well known
            to all English or Scottish school pupils.
            However, outside the Isles it may not be this well known, so here is the story.
        </p>

        <div class="foreignText">

            <p>
                <b>King</b> <b class="smallCaps">Robert the Bruce I</b> was born at Lochmaben
                Castle in 1274.
                He was Knight and Overlord of Annandale.
                In 1306 he was crowned King of Scotland and henceforth tried to free Scotland
                from the English enemy.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                After being defeated at a battle, Bruce escaped and found a hideout in a cave.
                Hiding in a cave for three months, Bruce was at the lowest point of his life.
                He thought about leaving the country and never coming back.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                While waiting, he watched a spider building a web in the cave's entrance.
                The spider fell down time after time, but finally he succeeded with his web.
                So Bruce decided also to retry his fight and told his men: <b>"If at first you
                don't succeed, try try and try again"</b>.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Old legend.
            </p>

        </div>


        <p>
            However, it is just a legend, and many facts about the story are not very clear.
            It is not even sure, in which year this story happened.
            Most likely it was 1306, after having been defeated by the Lord of Lorn at the
            battle in Strath-Fillan in 1306.
            After this battle, three of his four brothers were executed by the English, his
            sister was captured.
            Some sources tell it happended after being defeated at the battles of Methven
            and Dalry in the winter of 1313.
            He came back and won the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, even though his men were
            outnumbered ten to one.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Also it is not clear, <b>where</b> this story happened!
            The place was a hideout, so it was not well known, and later the story was told
            without telling the place.
            And in the coming centuries, several towns claimed to be the place.
            <b>Robert the Bruce</b> left the battlefields to go to Dunvarty and then to
            Rathlin.
            Along this route are several caves to be found.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Some caves, claiming to be the one are:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../gb/subterranea/Bruce.html"><img class="ui-li-icon ui-corner-none symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Cave.png" alt="Cave"><b><b>Bruce's Cave</b></b> in Kirkpatrick Fleming, Dumfriesshire.</a></li>
            <li><a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../gb/caves/King.html"><img class="ui-li-icon ui-corner-none symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Cave.png" alt="Cave"><b><b>King's Cave</b></b> at Drumadoon, near Blackwaterfoot on Arran Island.</a></li>
            <li><a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../gb/caves/Uamh-an-Righ.html"><img class="ui-li-icon ui-corner-none symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Cave.png" alt="Cave"><b><b>Uamh-an-Righ</b></b>, among the rocks of Craigruie.</a></li>
            <li><a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../ie/caves/Bruce.html"><img class="ui-li-icon ui-corner-none symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Cave.png" alt="Cave"><b><b>Bruce's Cave</b></b> on Rathlin Island, in Northern Ireland.</a></li>
            <li><a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../ie/caves/Oweynagolman.html"><img class="ui-li-icon ui-corner-none symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Cave.png" alt="Cave"><b><b>Oweynagolman Cave</b></b> on Rathlin Island, in Northern Ireland.</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The Bruce family favours the cave on Rathlin Island, off the north Antrim coast,
            because in the 14th century it was owned by his Irish mother.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At the end the story is partly historic reality, partly legend, the border is
            vague and much stays unclear.
            In general it is interpreted as a story of keeping faith confronted with
            overwhelming odds and thus finally being rewarded by success.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But one thing is absolutely sure about the whole story: to leave the cave, <b
                class="smallCaps">Bruce</b> must have destroyed the web across the cave's
            entrance...
            So all the <i>try, try and try again</i> was futile in the end, as it was in
            Scotish history.
        </p>
