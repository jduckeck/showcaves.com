        <p>
            A carbide lamp is a classic cavers and miners lamp.
            It was invented in the 19th century and is used until today.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In modern mining and in several caving areas carbide lamps are replaced by
            electric torches, typically helmet mounted lamps with big rechargeable
            batteries.
            But even today, a carbide lamp has a much brighter, more constant light, lasts
            longer than electric lamps, and is also more lightweight.
            But electric lamps are a bit cheaper, cost less work for maintenance and have no
            open light, important reasons to use them instead in mines and in fragile cave
            environments.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Carbide lamps were the first good caving lamps, as they produced no grime, were
            rather easy to handle and lasted long enough even for long tours.
            Carbide was easy to carry and very efficient.
            And the lamp was very common at the turn for the 19th to the 20th century, they
            were used for many purposes like bicycle lamps, carriage lamp, and even the
            first automobiles had this kind of lamps.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Carbide lamps are burning a gas and have a flame about the size of a candle
            flame.
            If the pressure of the gas is not too high, the flame burns nearly without grime
            and light is a little yellowish and warm.
            The lamp has a reflector, a shallow, concave tin, which is polished to reflect
            the light into one direction.
            As it is shallow, the lamp lights an rather wide angle in front of the
            reflector.
            As there is no glow wire, as in an electric bulb, there are no light rings and
            dark central spots as we know it from electric torches.
        </p>

            <b>Carbide</b> (aka <b>Calcium Carbide CaC<sub>
            <small>2</small>
        </sub></b>) is
            limestone, which is chemically alterated by burning it with coke in a specific
            process.
            When water is added an exothermic reaction starts, which produces limestone (at
            last) and <b>acetylene gas</b>.
            Acetylene gas has very low buoyancy and burns very hot.
            It burns nearly as hot as hydrogen, and is thus used for welding.
            The central reaction is the following one, which happens immediately when water
            and carbide get in touch:
        </p>

        <h2 align="center">CaC<sub>
            <small>2</small>
        </sub> + H<sub>
            <small>2</small>
        </sub>O => C<sub>
            <small>2</small>
        </sub>H<sub>
            <small>2</small>
        </sub> + CaO + heat
        </h2>

        <p>
            The principle of the lamp is very simple.
            The lamp has two chambers, the upper one is filled with water, the lower one is filled with carbide.
            A valve allows to direct little amounts of water, drop by drop from the upper into the lower chamber.
            This lower champer is pressure resistant and air proof, so the carbide reaction
            produces acetylene and a certain pressure.
            The acetylene now flows out the only possible way, through a burner.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The lamp is started by opening the water valve, and when the pressure is there,
            the valve is closed nearly completely.
            The brightness of the light is reguated by opening the valve a little bit, but
            the result of the change can only be seen after several minutes.
            To turn off the light, the valve is closed completely and then the flame gets
            smaller and smaller until it goes out.
        </p>
