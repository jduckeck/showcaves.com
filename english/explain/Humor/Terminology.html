            Often people outside caving circles overhear or are literally left in the dark when talking to cavers who throw around words like abseiling, pitch, fissure and flattener.
            To the lay person we cavers must sound crazy.
            For example how many people would know what was meant by this simple description of a caving trip.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            "We ground-trog for an hour before locating the entrance in a doline on the ridge above the resurgence.
            The first section was easily chimneyed to a large ledge overhanging a pitch.
            At the northern end of the ledge we used a jug-handle as the anchor point for the ladder trace and a large stalagmite for the belay point.
            A few of our group abseiled using cross-krabs.
            Next there was a tight squeeze followed by a long flattener.
            We emerged in a railway tunnel and followed it to the stream passage which eventually ended in a boulder choke."
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            I am quite sure we could all spin a few convincing yarns about the definitions of some of these words.
            Listed below are some of the not so correct word definitions and colloquial terms used in speleological circles.
