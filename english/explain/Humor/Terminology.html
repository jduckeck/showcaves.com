            Written by <b class="smallCaps">Garry K. Smith</b> with assistance from <b
                class="smallCaps">Pat</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Geoffry Hyde</b>, members of
            <b>Newcastle &amp; Hunter Valley Speleo Society</b>.
            Article as published in the <b>Australian Caver</b>, 134, 1993.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Often people outside caving circles overhear or are literally left in the dark
            when talking to cavers who throw around words like abseiling, pitch, fissure and
            flattener.
            To the lay person we cavers must sound crazy.
            For example how many people would know what was meant by this simple description
            of a caving trip.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            "We ground-trog for an hour before locating the entrance in a doline on the
            ridge above the resurgence.
            The first section was easily chimneyed to a large ledge overhanging a pitch.
            At the northern end of the ledge we used a jug-handle as the anchor point for
            the ladder trace and a large stalagmite for the belay point.
            A few of our group abseiled using cross-krabs.
            Next there was a tight squeeze followed by a long flattener.
            We emerged in a railway tunnel and followed it to the stream passage which
            eventually ended in a boulder choke."
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            I am quite sure we could all spin a few convincing yarns about the definitions
            of some of these words.
            Listed below are some of the not so correct word definitions and colloquial
            terms used in speleological circles.
