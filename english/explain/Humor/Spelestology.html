        <p class="definition">
            Spelestology (Latin spelaeum ‘cave’ and -logy; English spelestology) is a sub-discipline of historical science and materiality research that specializes in man-made underground structures, sites (Erdstalls) or passages (Schratzllöcher).

            <b>Spelestology</b> is a fake, this term does not exist.
            When I stumbled across this rather strange term, I was very irritated and started a search and found the following content on this term.

        <p>
            In science, terms are coined, you define a name for a thing.
            <b>It has four legs, is made of wood, and you can sit on it, which is how I define the name <i>chair</i>.</b>
            Later you have to adapt such definitions, for example you find chairs that are not made of wood, that only have three legs.
            You can also find armchairs that you can sit on but which are not chairs.
            Such processes can be found in abundance in speleological literature, terms that have changed and adapted to knowledge as understanding has increased.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            So what about the term <b>spelestology</b>?
            This term seems to have been coined for a Russian conference that took place in Nabereznye Cheln in Tatarstan in 2010.
            As a result, a journal was launched, also called <b>Speleology and Spelestology</b>.
            A facebook page was also created.
            A completely normal process.
            And if the term has a certain value, it will soon catch on in the scene.
            In other words, other researchers in the same field will use the new term, but only if it makes sense.
            However, that has not happened here.
            An obvious assumption is that the corruption of the term speleology was merely a joke to indicate that not only natural caves are being worked on.
            In this case, the term would have never been intended as a technical term, which also explains why it was never used by others.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            After 15 years, exactly one other scientist, namely the above linked Dr. <b class="smallCaps">Lea-Katharina Steller</b>, used the term exactly once.
            Presumably she then realized that there was something wrong with the term and has not used it since.
            Her research group “Spelästologie” produced a three-page report but never published anything else.
            Similarly, although the journal still has its own website, it has its home at a pedagogical university(!) in Tatarstan, whose website does not even mention an institute, let alone mention this journal as an official publication of the university.
            The journal’s page on <b>researchgate</b> has also been deleted in the meantime; they have obviously noticed that something is wrong.
            After all, the word does not appear in any publication, is not on the UIS list of technical terms and so on.
            But what is wrong?
        </p>

        <ul class="invisibleBox">
            <li>The German Wikipedia page was created by an unregistered user who only created this one page, which should set off the vandalism alarm!</li>
            <li>The Wikipedia page has so few references that at least the Wikipedia reference mafia has struck.
                Well, that’s not going to change because there’s nothing to reference.
            </li>
            <li>The only journal referenced is very curious, as it looks very important and lists a dozen affiliated organizations and two dozen scientists who are editors on its website.
                No idea if they know anything about their good fortune.
            </li>
            <li>So the term, if we assume that the journal really exists, was coined in Russian and is called <b>спелестология</b> which transliterates as <b>spelestologiya</b>.</li>
            <li>The explanation of the name Spelä<b>st</b>ologie was stolen from Speläologie, the <b>st</b> is not explained.
                For the rest, a reference to speleology would suffice, but the <b>st</b> must be explained.
                Unless the whole thing is just a joke.
            </li>
            <li><i>Spilaio</i>, the cave, is natural by definition, but this science deals with artificial cavities by definition.
                A blatant misnomer and because the term is only 15 years old, there is no excuse that it has “evolved historically”.
            </li>
            <li>It is referred to as part of historical science, namely the part that is underground.
                It is therefore disjunctive to speleology, which deals with natural caves and has very little to do with historical science.
                This makes the choice of name all the more nonsensical.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            So let’s summarize for a better understanding.
            The scientific term <b>spelestology</b> does not exist because it has never been defined by anyone in a scientific paper.
            That would be the minimum requirement for someone to say: you have four legs, I call you a chair.
            The Russian term спелестология exists, even if it is only used by a single journal.
            It is not used in the articles this journal contains, as far as I could find any.
            Again, how it came about is unclear, and as for the meaning of the <b>st</b>, one can only guess.
            Furthermore, the term is not used in German because we have the term <b>Erdstallforschung</b>, which actually means the same thing.
            And finally, the term never caught on in Russian either, which may be because it is a joke, which Russians recognize and laugh heartily about.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText red">
            UPDATE: in the meantime, the German Wikipedia page has been deleted, due to an extensive deletion discussion, which was also deleted.
            Very strange that Wikipedia constantly refuses to delete nonsense because freedom of information is more important, but when they delete something, they really do erase every trace of it.
            At least there is a version in the Internet Archive.
