                <td>
                    Every show cave, mine or subterranea on this site has a short list
                    of hard facts called <b>Useful Information</b>.
                    With a contemporary browser it will be displayed like this text, with
                    smaller font and darkgreen letters on white background.<br>
                    In the <b>Useful Information</b> block you find information in a very
                    brief form, which makes some explanation necessary.<br>
                    It is very difficult to write dates, fees and hours in a well readable
                    manner, so we always tried to find a sort of "international" way
                    of writing it, which should be understood by anybody.
                    But if you do not understand it, here is the explanation:
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <br>

        <p>
            It is rather difficult to find a way to write <b>date</b> and <b>time</b>
            in an international way!
            The standard notation differs even from one English speaking country to
            the next!
            So we tried to find a notation which is easy to understand, even if one is
            not used to it.
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li><b>Opening hours</b> are given in a 24 hour notation, there is nothing
                like a.m. and p.m..
                The 24 hour notation is used similar to military time in some countries.
                Unlike the Amerikan military time, which uses four digits for hours and
                minutes (HHMM), we use just the hour.<br>
                Example: 3 p.m. is 15, 5 p.m. is 17, and so on.
                Try yourself:<br><br>
                <div class="center">
                    <FORM>
                        <label>
                            <input type="text" name="pm" size=10>
                             p.m.
                        </label> p.m. <b>-></b>
                        <label>
                            <input type="text" name="twentyfour" size=10>
                        </label>
                        <input type="reset" value="Reset">
                        <input type="button" value="Transform" onClick="Compute(this.form)">
                    </form>
                </div>
                <br>
            </li>

            <li>Most public places open and close at the full hour.
                If minutes are needed, they are added to the hour, divided by "<b>:</b>".
                This mark is used only for times, and so it is easy to recognize that it means a time.<br>
                For example: half past 10 is <b>10:30</b>.
                <br><br>
            </li>

            <li><b>Dates:</b>
                The order in which year, month and day of a certain date are given differs
                extremely.
                A certain problem are dates with only numbers, e.g. <b>3/4/2003</b> would
                mean 4th of March in the USA and 3rd of April in Britain.
                An easy way to stop confusion between month and day is to write the name of
                the month.
                Very common and internationally used are the official IATA dates, which you
                will find on any flight ticket.
                Above date would be written <b>03APR2003</b>.
                As this is a little hard to read we also added a dash between the days,
                month and year.
                The days are given with two digits, the months are three letter
                abbreviations of the English names, the year is given in four digits.<br>
                For example: <b>03-APR-2003</b>.
                <br><br>
            </li>

            <li>Some open hours depend on religios, e.g. Christian or legal hollidays.
                This needs some explanations for non Christians:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Easter:</b>
                        In Europe it is common to open a cave at the <b>Easter</b> weekend,
                        which means the first open day will be <b>Good Friday</b>, the friday
                        before the Easter weekend.
                        All Easter and Pentecost related open hours are unfortunately different
                        every year, s Easter is always on a different weekend during March or
                        April.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Palm Sunday:</b> the Sunday before the Easter Weekend.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Pentecost:</b>
                        is seven weeks after Easter.
                        So if you know ehen Easer is, you also know when Pentecost is.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>All Saint's Day:</b> the 1st of November.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Memorial Day:</b>
                        Rather common in the USA is in spring and an easy to remember holyday.
                        Memorial Day used to be 30th May but is now observed on the last Monday in May.
                        Memorial Day is abbreviated <b>MD</b> on this site.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Labor Day:</b>
                        is on different days, depending on the country.
                        In the USA it is the first Monday in September.
                        In European Countries it is often on 1st May.
                        Labor Day is abbreviated <b>LD</b> on this site.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
            </li>

            <li>Unfortunately some open hours are based on <b>local school holdays</b>.
                As we can not maintain a list of worldwide school holidays, we ask you to
                search yourself for the actual dates on the internet.
                Typically they are pretty easy to find, e.g. with
                <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>.
                <br><br>
            </li>

            <li>If the age of the information is known, we give the year in which we
                obtained it in sqaure parentheses.
                Example: <b>[2007]</b>
                <br>
                Be aware that it may change every year.
                If you need precise, actual opening hours, please call the phone number
                given with the <a data-ajax="false" href="adress.html">address</a> or send an e-mail directly
                to the cave (not to us please).
                <br><br>
            </li>

            <li>The owners of show caves or mines may send actual information to us, we will
                add them as soon as possible.
                But we do not discuss with owners about removing hours, see comments below.
                And please do not insult us for "wrong" hours, it they are just a little
                outdated.
                This is a free service for both, owners and visitors, and nobody forces
                anyone to visit our site.
                <br><br>
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            We are doing our best in providing current and correct information about any
            cave or mine.
            Unfortunately some managements seem to spend much of their time in changing
            hours and fees.
            Some even refuse to give hours, in order to be <i>flexible</i>, whatever this
            may mean.
            So our main goal for those two topics is to give at least a correct set of a
            recent year, but not to keep it up to date at any cost.
            We guess it is good enough if the hours are not older than five years, and our
            visitors should be able to handle minor changes.
            If caves change the hours in an erratic way or have drastic changes, outdated
            hours on our site are their shame, not ours.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In general we prefer to spend our efforts on adding new sites, extending
            descriptions and adding background info, not those technical facts.
