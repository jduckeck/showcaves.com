                    Every show cave, mine or subterranea on this site has a short list
                    of hard facts called <b>Useful Information</b>.
                    With a contemporary browser it will be displayed like this text, with
                    smaller font and darkgreen letters on white background.<br>
                    In the <b>Useful Information</b> block you find information in a very
                    brief form, which makes some explanation necessary.<br>
                    It is very difficult to write dates, fees and hours in a well readable
                    manner, so we always tried to find a sort of "international" way
                    of writing it, which should be understood by anybody.
                    But if you do not understand it, here is the explanation:

        <p class="foreign">
            COVID-19: the pandemic had a great influence on public sites, because of varied and short lived restrictions.
            It is completely impossible for us to keep track of weekly changes and regional restrictions.
            We decided to ignore such restrictions completely, we do our best to update the regular open hours.
            However, some sites do not publish their regular hours, they replaced them by special times for the pandemic.
            If times are given for the year 2020 or 2021 please keep in mind that they might be different during and after the pandemic.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is rather difficult to find a way to write <b>date</b> and <b>time</b> in an international way!
            The standard notation differs even from one English-speaking country to the next!
            So we tried to find a notation which is easy to understand, even if one is not used to it.
        </p>

        <ul class="biglist">

            <li><b>Opening hours</b> are given in a 24-hour-notation, there is nothing like a.m. and p.m..
                The 24-hour-notation is used similar to military time in some countries.
                Unlike the American military time, which uses four digits for hours and minutes (HHMM), we use just the hour.<br>
                Example: 3 p.m. is 15, 5 p.m. is 17, and so on.
            </li>

            <li>Most public places open and close at the full hour.
                If minutes are needed, they are added to the hour, divided by "<b>:</b>".
                This mark is used only for times, and so it is easy to recognize that it means a time.<br>
                For example: half past 10 is <b>10:30</b>.
            </li>

            <li><b>Dates:</b>
                The order in which year, month and day of a certain date are given differs extremely internationally.
                Obviously dates with only numbers, e.g. <b>3/4/2003</b> would mean 4th of March in the USA and 3rd of April in Britain, which causes confusion.
                An easy way to stop this confusion between month and day is to write the name of the month instead of the number.
                Very common and internationally used are the official IATA dates, which you will find on any flight ticket.
                The above date would be written <b>03APR2003</b>.
                As this is a little hard to read, we also added a dash between the days, month and year.
                The days are given with two digits, the months are three letter abbreviations of the English names, the year is given in four digits.<br>
                For example: <b>03-APR-2003</b>.
            </li>

            <li>Some open hours depend on religious, e.g. Christian, or legal holidays.
                This needs some explanations for non-Christians:
                <ul class="biglist">
                    <li><b>Easter:</b>
                        In Europe it is common to open a cave at the <b>Easter</b> weekend,
                        which means the first open day will be <b>Good Friday</b>, the friday
                        before the Easter weekend.
                        All Easter and Pentecost related open hours are unfortunately different
                        every year, as Easter is always on a different weekend during March or April.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Palm Sunday:</b> the Sunday before the Easter Weekend.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Pentecost:</b>
                        is seven weeks after Easter.
                        So if you know when Easter is, you also know when Pentecost is.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>All Saint's Day:</b> the 1st of November.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Memorial Day:</b>
                        Rather common in the U.S.A. is in spring and an easy to remember holiday.
                        Memorial Day used to be 30th May but is now observed on the last Monday in May.
                        Memorial Day is abbreviated <b>MD</b> on this site.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Labor Day:</b>
                        is on different days, depending on the country.
                        In the U.S.A. it is the first Monday in September.
                        In European countries it is often on the 1st of May.
                        Labor Day is abbreviated <b>LD</b> on this site.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Unfortunately some open hours are based on <b>local school holidays</b>.
                As we can not maintain a list of worldwide school holidays, we ask you to search yourself for the actual dates on the internet.
                Typically, they are pretty easy to find, e.g. with
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>.
            </li>

            <li>If the age of the information is known, we give the year in which we obtained it in square parentheses.
                Example: <b>[2007]</b>
                <br>
                Be aware that it may change every year.
                If you need precise, actual opening hours, please call the phone number
                given with the <a data-ajax="false" href="adress.html">address</a> or send an e-mail directly to the cave (not to us please).
            </li>

            <li>The owners of show caves or mines may send up-to-date information to us, we will add them as soon as possible.
                But we do not discuss with owners about removing hours, see comments below.
                Please do not insult us for "wrong" hours if they are just a little outdated.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            We are doing our best in providing current and correct information about any cave or mine.
            Unfortunately, some managements seem to spend much of their time in changing hours and fees.
            Some even refuse to give hours, in order to be <i>flexible</i>, whatever this may mean.
            So our main goal for those two topics is to give at least a correct set of a recent year, but not to keep it up to date at any cost.
            We guess it is good enough if the hours are not older than five years, and our visitors should be able to handle minor changes.
            If caves change the hours in an erratic way or have drastic changes, outdated hours on our site are their shame, not ours.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In general we prefer to spend our efforts on adding new sites, extending descriptions and adding background info and pictures, not updating those technical facts.
