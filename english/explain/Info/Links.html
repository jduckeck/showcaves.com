                    They are open to the public, but only during certain opening hours and the visit costs an entrance fee.<br>
                    The symbol used is the Greek letter Omega, which is often used on maps for caves, mainly because its shape resembles a
                    Cave portal.
                    The <b>red colour</b> means show cave.

                <td><b>caves</b> are natural, underground cavities that are large enough to be entered by humans.
                    Basically any natural cavity that is not a show cave falls into this category.
                    But <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span> contains in this category almost exclusively the following two types of caves:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Large, easily accessible caves, which are easy to reach and easy to navigate.
                            Of course, appropriate equipment and common sense is a basic requirement for every visit.
                        </li>
                        <li>Special caves, especially famous or interesting caves, which are <b>not</b> freely accessible!
                            They are listed here for the sake of completeness, and also to explain the reasons why they are closed.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    The symbol used is the Greek letter Omega, which is often used on maps for caves, mainly because its shape resembles a
                    Cave portal.
                    The <b>b>black colour</b> means undeveloped cave.

                <td><b>Springs</b> are often associated with caves, they are then called karst springs.
                    Every underground cavity is of course a collection conduit and a path for groundwater.
                    The largest springs in the world are karst springs, in other words cave rivers that reach the surface at the cave entrance or resurgence.
                    So it is logical to describe the largest and most beautiful karst springs in the world on <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span>.
                    The symbol used is a blue circle, which is also often used on maps for sources.

                <td><b>Karst Features</b> are geological phenomena that are typical of karst areas.
                    Apart from caves, there are many interesting things worth seeing, such as sinkholes and swallow holes.<br>
                    The symbol used is a circle with radial lines, which is often used on maps for depressions, such as sinkholes.

                <td><b>Show Mines</b> are abandoned mines, which are developed with concrete trails, light and guided tours to give the visitor an insight into the work of the miners.
                    They are open to the public, but only during certain opening hours and the visit costs entrance fees.<br>
                    The symbol used is the miners' sign for a mine, <b>mallet and iron</b>.
                    The mallet is used as a hammer, the iron as a chisel with a handle.
                    Miners worked with these two tools for centuries.
                    It is also used on maps.

                <td><b>Subterranea</b> means any kind of artificial or man-made cavities and related museums.
                    The most common ones are cellars, tunnels, catacombs, speleological and mining museums.<br>
                    The symbol used shows a tunnel entrance, a symbol that is often used on maps.

                        We are linking only to sites about caves, mines, geology, and sometimes tourist sites.
                        However, we have no possibility to ensure the content of pages that are not maintained by us.
                        It may always have changed since our last visit.
                        <br>
                        By following any link leading out of this website, you accept, that <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span> is not responsible for the content you may find.

                    A link with the book logo will lead you to the named book.
                    The book logo usually takes you to a literature page or to a page on the internet that concerns a book on the topic.
                    This can be online versions of public domain books or a shop that sells the book.
                    Sometimes it is also used without a link for a literature reference.
