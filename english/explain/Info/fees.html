                <td>
                    Every show cave, mine or subterranea on this site has a short list
                    of hard facts called <b>Useful Information</b>.
                    With a contemporary browser it will be displayed like this text, with
                    smaller font and darkgreen letters on white background.<br>
                    In the <b>Useful Information</b> block you find information in a very
                    brief form, which makes some explanation necessary.<br>
                    It is very difficult to write dates, fees and hours in a well readable
                    manner, so we always tried to find a sort of "international" way
                    of writing it, which should be understood by anybody.
                    But if you do not understand it, here is the explanation:
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <br>

        <h2>All rates are subject to change without notice!</h2>

        <p>
            Fees may change every year!
            Even the official websites are often outdated.
            If you need actual fees, please call the phone number given with the <a target="_top" href="adress.html">address</a> or send an e-mail directly to the cave (not to us please).
        </p>

        <br>

        <ul>

            <li>Fees are always listed in <b>local currency</b>.
                Please use an online converter like google to convert them into your own currency.
            </li>

            <li><b>Adults</b> means <i>regular</i> price.
                This price applies if no reduction applies.
            </li>

            <li>If known, the age range for children prices is given in brackets.
                Younger children are by default free, older ones have to pay adult fees.
                In some countries the school is used (Elementary School, Highschool College), which requires a little background inf on the school system.
                However, in general this terms are just synonyms for age ranges.
                <br>
                Example: <b>Children (4-14) USD 4</b> children aged four to 14 inclusive.
                <br>
                Some countries have the custom to use the size of the children, probably because they can check this with a line on the wall without needing a passport.
                <br>
                Example: <b>Children (<1.2 m) free</b> children which are smaller than 1.20 m.
            </li>

            <li><b>Students</b> are visitors which are able to present a student id, as a foreign visitor an ISIC card.
                This typically includes university students and high school students.
                If the Children fee is cheaper you might opt for that ticket.
                If there is a maximum age we give it in round brackets.
                <br>
                Example: <b>Students (-25) USD 4</b>
            </li>

            <li><b>Seniors</b> are visitors which are retired.
                As there is no retirement id card in most countries, it typically applies at the local retirement age.
                If there is a minimum age we give it in round brackets, and you will need an id to prove your age.
                If there is a retirement card, just show it.
                <br>
                Example: <b>Seniors (65+) USD 4</b>
            </li>

            <li><b>Disabled</b> are visitors which have a corresponding legal status.
                In other words, you will get the rate if you have a document or id which tells you are disabled.
                This is necessary as the guy at the ticket office is not able to decide if you are disabled, he is not a doctor.
                In many cases a second person accompanying the disable is free or reduced too.
            </li>

            <li><b>Journalists</b> are usually given free admission to sightseeing attractions, even if they are not coming on business.
                The reason is simple: it is a bribe to get a good review.
                Conversely, journalists obviously have no inhibitions about accepting such bribes; on the contrary, they can be extremely gruff when they have to pay.
                However, we are neither journalists nor operators and will not make any effort to support this outdated concept.
                We do not list such special schemes unless they are funny.
            </li>

            <li class="fun"><b>Heroes</b> is a group of people we actually only know from Russia, but there are other countries with similar categories.
                In Russia it includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Veterans of the Great Patriotic War (aka World War II).</li>
                    <li>Heroes of the Soviet Union.</li>
                    <li>Heroes of the Russian Federation and persons equated to them.</li>
                    <li>Full holders of the Order of Glory.</li>
                    <li>Servicemen doing military service by conscription.</li>
                    <li>Heroes of Socialist Labor.</li>
                    <li>Heroes of Labor of the Russian Federation.</li>
                    <li>Full holders of the Order of Labor Glory.</li>
                    <li>Former prisoners of fascist concentration camps.</li>
                    <li>Citizens of the Russian Federation who performed military and official duties in the Republic of Afghanistan or other countries in which hostilities were fought.</li>
                    <li>Participants in the liquidation of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.</li>
                    <li>Persons awarded the medal of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation "For the return of Crimea".</li>
                </ul>
                Similar lists exist in other countries, but the Russian one is actually the most absurd we found.
                We are not sure how "heroes of the liquidation of the consequences of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant" identify themselves at the box office.
                Do they get special member cards?
                An entry in the passport?
                A tattoo?
            </li>

            <li class="fun"><b>Politicians</b> is another strange group, which enters free in some countries.
                The following examples are from China:
                <ul>
                    <li>deputies to the National People’s Congress</li>
                    <li>members of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference at or above the county or municipal level</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><b>Group rates</b> include the necessary number of people to get them.
                Be aware that most sites give reductions for groups only if they prebook and/or pay together.
                You will get a bill or receipt instead of individual tickets.
                <br>
                Example: <b>Groups (15+): Adults ....</b> means groups of 15 and more people get the special rate.
            </li>

            <li><b>Group rates</b> often include some persons for free.
                Typically, the bus driver and the guide are free, or the teacher of a school class.
                Some give one free entrance per a certain amount of people in the group.
                It is very difficult to understand some of the more fantastic rules, it is almost impossible to list them here in a brief way.
                So we decided to omit them.
                And we even found places where a group price is made by haggling.
                <br>
                <b>If you are organizing a group trip and need exact fees, always call the site!</b>
            </li>

            <li><b>Guest Cards</b> exist all over the world in various flavours.
                Some give reductions, some open all sights for free.
                It is almost impossible to list all guest cards as some of them tend to live only a short time.
                However, if we read of guest cards we list the appropriate fee.
            </li>

            <li>If the age of the information is known, we give the year in which we obtained it in square parentheses.
                Example: <b>[2020]</b>
            </li>

            <li>The owners of show caves or mines may send actual information to us, we will add them as soon as possible.
                If the correct prices are given on the official website, we actually only need the trigger to update them.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            We are doing our best in providing current and correct information about any cave or mine.
            So our main goal for those two topics is to give at least a correct set of a recent year, but not to keep it up to date at any cost.
            We guess it is good enough if the fees are not older than five years, and our visitors should be able to add general inflation themselves.
            In general, we prefer to spend our efforts on adding new sites, extending descriptions and adding background info, not those technical facts.
            To check almost 5,000 sites every year is not possible, this website is managed by volunteers.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Please refrain from insulting us with accusations of "wrong" admission prices when they are merely outdated.
            The prices were quite correct in the year indicated.
            As an operator, send us the current price list, visitors send us a smartphone photo of the price list by email.
            If the prices are given on the official website, a note <b>that</b> they have been updated is sufficient.
            We update as soon as possible.
        </p>
