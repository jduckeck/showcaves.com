Every show cave, mine or subterranea on this site has a short list
of hard facts called <b>Useful Information</b>.
With a contemporary browser it will be displayed like this text, with
smaller font and darkgreen letters on white background.<br>
In the <b>Useful Information</b> block you find information in a very
brief form, which makes some explanation necessary.<br>
It is very difficult to write dates, fees and hours in a well readable
manner, so we always tried to find a sort of "international" way
of writing it, which should be understood by anybody.
But if you do not understand it, here is the explanation:

<h2>All rates are subject to change without notice!</h2>

<p>
Fees may change every year!
Even the official websites are often outdated.
If you need actual fees, please call the phone number given with the
<a href="adress.html">address</a> or send an e-mail directly
    to the cave (not to us please).
</p>

<br>

<ul>

<li>Fees are always listed in <b>local currency</b>.
    Please use
    <ul>
    <li><a target="_blank"  href="http://www.xe.net/currency/index.html"><img src="../../../graphics/symbol/World.png" alt="World" class="ui-li-icon ui-corner-none"><b>The Universal Currency Converter</b>
    <li class="liWorld"   ><a target="_blank"  href="http://www.oanda.com/converter/classic">Classic 164 Currency Converter</a>
    </ul>
    to convert them into your own currency.
<br><br></a></li>

<li><b>Adults</b> means regular price.
    This price applies if no reduction applies.
<br><br>
</li>

<li>If known, the age range for children prices is given in brackets.
    Younger children are by default free, older ones have to pay adult fees.<br>
    Example: <b>Children (4-14) USD 4</b>
<br><br>
</li>

<li><b>Group rates</b> include the necessary number of people to get them.<br>
    Example: <b>Groups (15+): Adults ....</b> means groups of 15 and more people
    get the special rate.
    Be aware that often the caves give reductions for groups only if they
    prebook and/or pay together.
<br><br>
</li>

<li><b>Group rates</b> often include some persons for free.
    Typically the bus driver and the guide are free.
    Some give one free entrance per a certain amount of people in the group.
    It is very difficult to understand some of the more phantastic rules, it is
    almost impossible to list them here in a brief way.
    So we decided to omitt them.
    <b>If you are organizing a group trip and need exact fees, always call the
    site!</b>
<br><br>
</li>

<li><b>Guest Cards</b> exist all over the world in various flavours.
    Some give reductions, some open all sights for free.
    It is almost impossible to list all guest cards as some of them tend
    to live only a short time.
    However, if we read of guest cards we list the appropriate fee.
<br><br>
</li>

<li>If the age of the information is known, we give the year in which we
    obtained it in sqaure parentheses.
    Example: <b>[2007]</b>
    <br>
    Be aware that it may change every year.
    If you need precise, actual fees, please call the phone number
    given with the <a href="adress.html">address</a> or send an e-mail directly
    to the cave (not to us please).
<br><br>
</li>

<li>The owners of show caves or mines may send actual information to us, we will
    add them as soon as possible.
    But we do not discuss with owners about removing prices, see comments below.
    And please do not insult us for "wrong" fees, it they are just a little
    outdated.
    This is a free service for both, owners and visitors, and nobody forces
    anyone to visit our site.
<br><br>
</li>

</ul>

<p>
We are doing our best in providing current and correct information about any
cave or mine.
Unfortunately some managements seem to spend much of their time in changing
hours and fees.
Some even refuse to give fees, in order to be "flexible", whatever this may
mean.
So our main goal for those two topics is to give at least a correct set of a
recent year, but not to keep it up to date at any cost.
We guess it is good enough if the fees are not older than five years, and our
visitors should be able to add general inflation themselves.
If caves change the prices in an erratic way or have drastic increases, outdated
prices on our site are their shame, not ours.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
In general we prefer to spend our efforts on adding new sites, extending
descriptions and adding background info, not those technical facts.
