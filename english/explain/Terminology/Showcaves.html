        <p class="definition">
            A show cave is a cave that is used for tourism.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a rather simple definition, and therefore it is unfortunately wrong.
            Especially with the development of extreme sports, which also include canyoning, cave trekking and various other cave uses, it is unfortunately no longer adequate.
            The term, which dates back to the development of cave tourism in the 19th century, underwent a transformation during the 20th century.
            But even in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the 19th century, a cave did not become a show cave simply because someone visited it for tourism.
            Tourists are people who visit something without having the necessary skills to do so, so for them, the place has to be prepared in such a way that it is safe enough.
            This is easy to understand when you think of paths and lighting systems.
            Also, artificial access tunnels that make diving or abseiling unnecessary.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But now it gets a bit complicated: what is a show cave?
            Is it a cave with an artificial access tunnel?
            In fact, there are some caves that have one but are not used for tourism.
            Conversely, there are also many caves that are definitely show caves but do not have an artificial tunnel.
            Therefore, we quote the definition by <b class="smallCaps">Hubert Trimmel</b>:
        </p>

        <p class="definition">
            Geeignete Höhlen werden für den Besuch einer größeren Zahl von Menschen zugänglich gemacht.
            Die dazu notwendigen Arbeiten werden als <b>Höhlenerschließung</b> bezeichnet.
            Finden in erschlossenen Höhlen fallweise oder regelmäßig Führungen statt, so spricht man von <b>Schauhöhlenbetrieben</b>.
            <br>
            Suitable caves are made accessible for visiting by a larger number of people.
            The work necessary for this is called cave development.
            If guided tours take place in developed caves on a case-by-case or regular basis, they are called show cave operations.
            <br>
            <b class="smallCaps">Hubert Trimmel</b> (1968): <b>Höhlenkunde</b>, Vieweg, p. 190.
        </p>

        <p class="">
            Let's look at this more closely, it is necessary for a cave to be developed and then also used for tourism.
            That makes a lot of sense.
            Many caves are equipped with artificial entrances and ladders over time, but to facilitate research.
            Especially when a siphon restricts access to cave divers, cave explorers regularly dig access tunnels.
            Climbing aids make material transport safer and the approach shorter.
            Conversely, if a cave is used for tourism without being developed, it obviously serves as an extreme sports facility.
            Whether one goes to a climbing park, canyoning, or abseiling in a cave, the sporting aspect is paramount.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            And yet there are many cases that go beyond that.
            What about the show cave that filed for bankruptcy three years ago and therefore can no longer be visited?
            What about the cave that has such a flat floor that any construction of paths is completely unnecessary?
            And what is the opposite of a show cave, an undeveloped cave?
            And are there only these two categories or perhaps others?
            We have therefore made a list of optional features that show caves should have:
        </p>

        <div class="definition">
            <ol class="invisibleBox">
                <li><b>Cave:</b> it is a cave, i.e. a natural, underground cavity</li>
                <li><b>Worthiness:</b> the cave has a special feature that makes the visit worthwhile, size, stalactites, archaeological feature or similar</li>
                <li><b>Paths:</b> developed, accessible on paths and stairs, with railings and safeguards, in particular developed in such a way that no special skills are necessary on the part of the visitors and there is no particular danger</li>
                <li><b>Light:</b> equipped with lighting, at least a torch is provided</li>
                <li><b>Entrance fee:</b> there is a charge, the money is used to maintain the facilities, to finance the lighting, the guides and as income for the operator</li>
                <li><b>Opening hours:</b> have regulated opening hours, regularly recurring times when the cave can be visited, because that is the prerequisite for interested people to visit it</li>
                <li><b>Locking:</b> they are only accessible during opening hours, otherwise locked, to protect the cave</li>
                <li><b>Guided tours:</b> the guide accompanies the visitors, explains, entertains, but also pays attention to the protection of the cave</li>
                <li><b>Access:</b> in addition to the cave itself, access for ordinary people is also possible, this includes access road, car park, in special cases also cable car or lift</li>
                <li><b>Infrastructure:</b> for the stay until the start of the tour, seating, souvenir shop, café, restaurant, playground, barbecue area, museum, network of paths</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>
            In fact, there are examples for each of these points, caves that do not meet them and yet are considered show caves.
            For example, Frauenmauer Cave has no electric light (4.) and no proper paths (3.).
            The Schellenberg Ice Cave requires a walk of several hours (10.).
            There are even show caves which are not caves at all (1.), for example, the Schloßberghöhlen Homberg or the Saalfelder Feengrotten are often listed as show caves, both are show mines.
            And then there are countries in which the level of development is generally lower than in industrialized nations, and beaten tracks are regarded as development and light is a lantern.
            But in general, a show cave is simply a cave that meets most of these requirements.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            We have dealt with this problem again and again over decades and have agreed on the following definition.
            So far, we have only had to revise our classification in very few cases.
            The definition is less catchy than those above, but still, we believe, helpful.
        </p>

        <div class="definition">
            <ul>
                <li>A <b>show cave</b> is a cave, i.e. a <b>natural</b> underground cavity, large enough for people to enter.</li>
                <li>A <b>show cave</b> is a cave that is used for <b>tourism</b>.</li>
                <li>There are two classes of show caves, the <b>developed</b> and the <b>semi-wild</b> caves. The border is exactly where above-average physical fitness is required or where there is a risk of accidents.</li>
                <li><b>Protection</b> by a gate or guide is mandatory; if it is not given, it is a sacrificial cave.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
            Since we list show mines and all kinds of artificial cavities as well, the first rule only decides the categorisation.
            Tourist use, and not once, but repeatedly is the criterion for a tourist cave.
            We have divided these into two classes, show caves in the narrower sense and so-called "semi-wild" caves.
            The latter is a rather weak euphemism for a cave that has been made less dangerous with fixtures.
            As there is no actual term, we called them simply <b>caves</b>, to make clear they are not or only rudimentarily developed.
            The border is therefore exactly where physical fitness, a head for heights or similar is required, or where there is a risk of injury due to inadequate safety.
        </p>
