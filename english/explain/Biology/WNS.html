        White-nose Syndrome has devastated bat populations across the eastern United
        States during the past four years, causing "the most precipitous wildlife
        decline in the past century in North America," according to biologists. And this
        relentless disease keeps spreading into new areas. BCI is working with agencies,
        organizations and individuals to understand and stop WNS and begin restoring
        these decimated bat populations.

        White-nose Syndrome has killed more than a million bats since it was discovered
        in a single New York cave in February 2006. Nine bat species in 18 states have
        now been documented with either WNS or the fungus, Geomyces destructans, that is
        the likely cause of this devastating disease.

        Named for a cold-loving white fungus typically found on the faces and wings of
        infected bats, White-nose Syndrome causes bats to awaken more often during
        hibernation and use up the stored fat reserves that are needed to get them
        through the winter. Infected bats often emerge too soon from hibernation and are
        often seen flying around in midwinter. These bats usually freeze or starve to
        death.

        Mortality rates approaching 100 percent are reported at some sites. White-nose
        Syndrome has now moved into Canada, Maryland, Tennessee and Missouri. It
        threatens some of the largest hibernation caves for endangered Indiana myotis,
        gray myotis, and Virginia big-eared bats. Ultimately, bats across North America
        are at imminent risk.

        What is White-nose Syndrome? White-nose
        Syndrome (WNS) is a new disease that is causing
        the most precipitous decline of North American
        wildlife in the past century. It has killed more than
        one million bats in five years and threatens to
        devastate bat populations across the continent.
        Nearly 100 percent of bats have died at some
        sites.

        Why is it called White-nose Syndrome? This
        affliction was given its name because of a telltale
        white fungus that grows on the noses (and
        sometimes wings, ears and tails) of most infected
        bats. This fungus is new to science and has been
        named Geomyces destructans.

        Which bats are dying? Six bat species have
        been affected by WNS so far: little brown myotis
        (Myotis lucifugus), big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus),
        tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus), northern
        myotis (Myotis septentrionalis), eastern small-
        footed myotis (Myotis leibii), and the endangered
        Indiana myotis (Myotis sodalis). Another three
        species have been detected with WNS-associated
        fungus: gray bats (Myotis grisescens), southeastern
        bats (Myotis austroriparius) and cave myotis (Myotis
        velifer). These species have not yet been
        diagnosed with the disease. If current infection
        and mortality patterns continue, 25 species of
        hibernating bats in the United States could
        decline, and WNS could threaten some
        previously common species with extinction.

        How is it transmitted? Although bat-to-bat
        transmission is believed to be the primary route,
        circumstantial evidence suggests humans may also
        inadvertently carry WNS from infected sites to
        clean sites.

        How fast is it spreading? WNS, first detected
        in New York in February 2006, has spread rapidly
        throughout the eastern United States. Last year, it
        spread 450 miles in a single winter. WNS or its
        associated fungus is now documented in 18 U.S.
        states and 4 Canadian provinces. Biologists fear it
        will reach the largest colonies of endangered
        Indiana, gray and Virginia and Ozark big-eared
        bats this winter. A current map of WNS spread
        can be found at www.batcon.org/wns.

        Why do bat die-offs from WNS matter?
        The number of insects consumed annually by one
        million bats, the estimated number of WNS
        fatalities to date, is staggering: just under 700
        tons. These bats have extraordinary value in
        maintaining the health of nearly all terrestrial and
        aquatic ecosystems. And since many of the insects
        eaten by bats are crop pests, losing large numbers
        of bats will likely have expensive impacts on
        agriculture.

        How soon will bat populations recover? Bats
        are long-lived but slow-reproducing mammals.
        Bats of most species have an average lifespan of
        more than 20 years and give birth to only one
        pup each year. Where WNS has killed large
        numbers, it is unlikely bat populations will
        recover to pre-WNS levels in our lifetime - if
        ever.

        White-Nose Syndrome: A Crisis for America's Bats


        How does WNS kill bats? Although the root
        causes of mortality associated with WNS are still
        under investigation, most available evidence
        suggests the newly described fungus is capable of
        causing this disease.
        Hibernating bats affected by WNS are
        characterized by some or all of these symptoms:
        1) a white fungus that grows on the nose, ears
        and wing membranes; 2) depleted fat reserves
        due to increased winter arousals long before bats
        normally arouse from hibernation in the spring;
        3) a compromised immune response during
        hibernation; 4) damage or scarring of the wings;
        and 5) abnormal bat behavior (for example, bats
        emerge too soon from hibernation and are often
        seen flying around in midwinter, which usually
        means they will freeze or starve to death).

        What is being done to slow the spread of
        WNS? The only tool currently available to slow
        the spread of WNS is restricting access to caves.
        Regional and local cave closures have been
        implemented in an attempt to slow the spread of
        WNS by reducing the likelihood of human
        transmission (http://www.caves.org/WNS/).
        Researchers are exploring the feasibility of several
        potential treatments against WNS. Until we
        understand the relationship between the fungus
        and WNS, however, we dare not risk damaging
        these sensitive and complex cave ecosystems by
        introducing fungicides or other treatments.

        What about Mexico's bats? The ecological
        and geographical limits of White-nose Syndrome
        are not yet understood. Any hibernating bats are
        likely at risk for WNS, although preliminary
        evidence suggests bats that do not hibernate for
        long periods may experience lower mortality
        rates. At this point, we do not know what effect
        WNS may have on bats in Mexico. Although
        there is no projected timeline for when WNS
        might reach Mexico, it is prudent to follow
        disinfection guidelines for caving and bat-capture
        gear to reduce the chance of human transmission.

        What Can You Do to Help? Urgent and
        effective conservation action is critical if we are
        to avoid endangering additional species and
        perhaps even seeing some species become
        extinct! There are things you can do to help:

        1)  - Educate your friends and families about the
        benefits of bats and the threat of White-nose
        Syndrome.
        2)  - Encourage your state and federal legislators to
        allocate funding for efforts to understand and
        fight this devastating disease.
        3)  - Report unusual late-winter bat behavior (such
        as bats flying during the daytime) or unexplained
        bat deaths to your state wildlife agency.
        4)  - Adhere to state, federal and local cave
        advisories and closures to help prevent the
        transmission of WNS.
        5)  - When you enter caves, carefully follow
        decontamination protocols outlined by the U.S.
        Fish and Wildlife Service. You'll find updated
        protocols at http://www.fws.gov/northeast
        /wnsresearchmonitoring.html .
        6)  - Donate to BCI's WNS Rapid Response Fund a
