All aspects of the national park are covered with chapters on Geography, Geology, Speleology, Fungi, Fauna, Archaeology, Architecture, Ethnology,
                Mountains and climbing, Tourism etc. The first account of caving in Biokovo dates from 1774 when Alberto Fortis described in his book "A Journey Through Dalmatia" some natural ice pits. Many of these shafts have north facing entrance preserving the ice even summer. In the days before refrigerators these ice pits were highly sought after for
                preserving food. The most famous cave in the Park is Tucepska Vilenjaca at a height of 1180 m above sea level. A small hole at the bottom of a 100 m high rock face leads 2 km long cave with some impressive speleothems. Vilenjaca means "Cave of Fairies" and legend has it that beautiful blonde girls with horses legs lived in the cave and used
                to scare passers-by in the dark. The deepest cave in the Park is Jama (Pothole) Amfors - 788 m and with an entrance1590 m above sea level. It is located 1 km south of Sveti Jure. It is a very strenuous cave, near vertical with very little horizontal development. HB In Croatian &pound;9.00
