<h1 align="center">The Longest Caves of the World</h1>
<h2 align="center"></h2>

<br clear="all">

<p>
The length of caves is a number which may be extracted from survey data.
It is rather easy to determine, if a cave is surveyed, and despite it is not the
only way to measure the size of caves, it is the only one which is <b>well
defined</b> and <b>internationally accepted</b>.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Length and depth are the only size parameters of caves, which are collected in
international statistics, see the link to the pages of the Geology and Geography
Section of the National Speleological Society below.
There are different lists for long caves, first an international one, and then
one for each country.
All those lists mostly list karst caves, because those generally get longer than
other types of caves.
Second are lava tubes, so there are lists only for lava tubes too.
And of course there are other lists for other types of caves, like gypsum caves
or sea caves.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Like other statistics they change frequently and the position of a cave may
change every time the list is updated.
However, the cave on the first place are so much longer than those on the
second, it is unlikely others will cath up soon.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
As we said, there are different ways to measure the size of caves.
Alternative representative mesures are the <b>area</b> of the ground and the
<b>volume</b> of a cave.
Both are rather easy to compute with a good software, but they require survey
techniques which are uncommon and differ between countries.
In addition to the normal survey data, which consists of a sort of polyline
through the passages, the distance to the walls and to ceiling and floor must
be collected.
The distance to the walls gives the width of the passage which is necessary to
compute the area of the floor.
Additionally the distance to ceiling and floor and the form of the passage is
needed to compute the volume.
This data is not collected in most surveys, and additionally the results are
extremely inaccurate, because of the irregular shapes of most caves.
As a resulte there do not exist international lists of caves by area or volume,
although there might be some national lists.

The surveyed lenght is at the moment 590,629m [2006], more than 590 kilometers,

This is so far longer than any other cave system, that it is very unlikely to
find any other cave of this length on Earth.

<td valign="top">
is the longest underwater cave of the world.
The caves in Mexico are huge cave systems which developed inside a low limestone
plateau during the Ice Ages.
When most of the water is frozen in several kilometers thick glaciers, the level
of the sea is 100m deeper.
The caves developed from the sea level and are today completely filled with
water, both sea water and sweet water from above.
As a result almost all long underwater caves are located in Mexico, some in
Florida with a similar genesis.
Sistema Ox Bel Ha is 180,039m long [2009], but as it is difficult to explore
underwater caves, there are still many unexplored leads.
