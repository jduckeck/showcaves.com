            <b>Salt</b> (sodium chloride) is different from other typical mining products,
            as it is necessary for living, it is an important part of our food.
            Thus salt is probably the first thing which was mined and it has been a sort of
            currency for millennia.
            The first known salt works are about 8,000 years old, found in the Shanxi
            province of China.
            Salt lakes and sea water were the source for salt water which was boiled in clay
            pots.
            In some areas of the world, the sun is suficcient to dry the water, at least
            during some parts of the year.
            In other areas salt exists on the surface and is mined in shallow open pits.
            In the Sahara the salt is mined and transported into the south, the subtropic
            prairies and rain forests with caravans.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Very early true salt mining, even underground, started.
            In areas with no salt pans and remote from the sea, it was vital to find salt
            deposits which could be mined, otherwise salt had to be transported over
            enormous distances.
            In the Austrian salt mines around Salzburg (mention the name), Celtic remains
            like shoes and wooden tools were found, which are some 3,000 years old.
            The mining in salt mines is a little easier than in other mines, as salt is
            rather soft, so it was possible even with stone age tools.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Today there are two different ways of underground salt mining.
            The first is <b>mechanical mining</b> by creating huge caverns and tunnels
            inside the salt, big enough to drive trucks inside.
            Salt is scratched off the walls by huge machines and transported to the surface
            in its solid form, on conveyor belts or heavy trucks.
            This works very well if the salt is either found in massive layers or in huge
            diappirs.
            And of course if the salt is very pure.
            The salt is used without any cleaning process for industrial processes and as
            road salt.
            The mined salt is actually <b>unrefined salt</b>, which means it contains
            various different salts beneath sodium chloride.
            It is called <b>rock salt</b> or <b>halite</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The second method is <b>solutional mining</b>.
            The salt is mined in the form of <b>brine</b> and the water then evaporated.
            Sometimes natural brine springs are used, but mostly fresh water is pumped into
            salt bearing layers and pumped back to the surface after it is saturated with
            salt.
            The brine has the maximum amount of soluted salt which is possible, 26.4% salt
            by weight at a temperature of 15Â°C.
            To clean the salt it is always important to solute it in water and filter it,
            which removes the unsoluble solids like clay.
            The treatment with chemicals follows, which precipitate most impurities.
            By evaporation in multiple stages, the different kinds of salts, like sodium,
            magnesium and calcium salts, are separated, a process called refining.
            And finally, if the salt is used for food an anticaking agent may be added.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Evaporation</b> is the way the salt deposits all over the world were formed.
            Salt, contained in small amounts in any rock, is washed into the sea.
            In the sea the amount of salt rises since million of years.
            But when parts of the sea are cut off and the weather is dry, the water
            evaporates and the salt remains.
            The salt is deposited in a sequence, first the salt types which are hard to
            dissolve are deposited, then the next and so on.
            The typical sequence of those <b>evaporites</b> is limestone, gypsum, sodium
            salt and finally potash.
            If the salt is covered by mud or sand later, the formation of the salt deposit
            is complete.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Other important geologic processes connected with salt are the
            <b>halokinetic</b> processes.
            Salt under high pressure and high temperature starts to flow very slowly.
            Although it looks still hard as a rock, it is deformed by the pressure of the
            rock above.
            If there are fractures in the rocks the salt starts to flow upwards forming huge
            diapirs or salt domes.
            Often those diapirs are mined, as they are less deep.
            Sometimes they reach the surface, although the salt layer is three kilometers
            deeper, for example in northern Germany.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Salt mines are of impressive size, and as salt is hygroscopic, they are
            extremely dry too.
            This is a big difference to other mines.
            The air is very pure and full of salt, and many people think this air has
            healing powers.
            There are abandoned mines which are now used for <b>halotherapy</b>, especially
            in eastern Europe.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Some countries use abandoned mines for the storage of various goods.
            Because of the size, the chambers are easily accessible by trucks, so it is
            possible to store a lot of things, like documents, valuables, art, and food.
            Some are used to dump dangerous chemicals or (unfortunately) radioactive waste.
            Some mines are used for underground bicycle races.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Beneath mines producing <b>sodium chloride</b>, which is the salt we know from
            the kitchen, there are also mines producing <b>potash</b> (potassium carbonate).
            Looking similar to halite, except probably for the fact that it is reddish, this
            salt has a different chemical structure based on potassium instead of sodium.
            It is used mostly as fertilizer, but also in the manufacture of glass and soap.
