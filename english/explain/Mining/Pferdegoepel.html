            The <b>whim</b> is the simplest machine with which the muscle power of a person or draft animal can be transferred to an axle.
            The muscle power is converted into a rather slow rotation.
            If other speeds are required, the rotation of the main axle must be converted to a different speed via a gear transmission.
            The rotary motion is transmitted to external machines via wooden drive shafts or belts.

            Mining started on the surface with open pits, but at a certain depth the water, groundwater and rainwater began to flow into the mine and flood it.
            So it was necessary, absolutely essential, to have a way of pumping out water.
            This is a very specialized application because it has to be pumped continuously and the amount of energy required is much higher than what a miner can manage with muscle power.
            In addition, it should be possible to pump much more if necessary, as flooding could occur after heavy rainfall or if an aquifer was cut.
            On the other hand, a mine is immobile, it was possible to use an engine which was stationary.
            In the Middle Ages, there were two possible types of power source, water power and muscle power.
            We deal with water power on a separate page, here we look at the various systems powered by muscles.
            Some say that a third source was the wind, but the wind-wheels were not efficient enough, and they were also too unreliable; when the wind failed, the pumps stopped.
            Before the invention of steam engines, horse mills were used if water power was not available.
            The first applications of mechanical power in mining were used for pumping and transporting miners and ore.
            This page is about mining-related machinery and terminology, so these are the most widespread types of muscle powered engines related to mining.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The use of engines began in mining in Central Europe in the 14th century.
            Historical works such as <b class="smallCaps">Georgius Agricola</b>’s book <b>De Re Metallica Libri XII</b> describe the first uses.
            This early machinery was built in wood, as metal was very expensive.
            As a result, only a few are still in existence today, although some have been reconstructed from old engravings.
            The types of engines are differentiated according to how the power is transmitted to the shaft.
            There are two fundamentally different types, horizontal (horizontal) and vertical (vertical) axis.
        </p>


        <ul class="invisibleBox">

            <li><b>Manual Winch</b> oder <b>Manual Lift</b>:
                Known to non-miners as a <b>hand crank</b>, this is simply a man powered crank with jack-rolls or windlasses for a rope.
                There may also be a deflection pulley.
                If you lower the rope into a shaft, you can raise or lower buckets.
                This can be used to fetch water from the mine, transport ores upwards or lower tools or food downwards.
                However, they are not suitable for heavy loads, the weight is limited by the strength and endurance of the miner who drives them.
                The earliest use was probably in stone age flint mines, or for pulling water from wells.
                This type has a horizontal axis.
            </li>

            <li><b>Treadmill</b>:
                This is what we know as a <b>hamster wheel</b>.
                A cylinder with a horizontal axle, big enough for people or animals to walk on top or inside.
                It was typically a huge lying tube made of wooden slats.
                If you run in one direction, it goes uphill, but your body weight pushes the cylinder downwards, and it spins away underneath you.
                You quickly achieve a kind of equilibrium.
                Such engines were also used as drives for cranes, examples have been known since Roman times.
                If more power was needed, longer cylinders were used and several people or animals ran side by side.
                There were two different construction types, the "muscle" walked either inside at the lowest point or outside almost at the top, but both variations used exactly the same effect.
                For safety reasons, however, it was necessary to attach covers or railings when walking on top, otherwise there was a considerable risk of falling off the large tube.
                This type was quite popular in the labour camps and prisons of the 18th and 19th centuries.
                This type has a horizontal axis.
            </li>

            <li><b>Whim</b>, <b>Mill</b>, <b>Sweep Mill</b>, or <b>Sweep Power</b>:
                This is now the most common form in mining and has been recorded many times in drawings and engravings.
                A vertical axle is driven by people or animals moving slowly around it.
                A rod or beam projecting radially outwards is pushed or pulled.
                Again, the force can be increased by increasing the team, attaching more rods, but typically there are two crossing beams, which means four ends.
                The beams can also be extended, to place more than one horse.
                But such whims start with a single horse.
                This type has a vertical axis.
            </li>

            <li><b>Horse Whim</b>, <b>Horse Mill</b>, or <b>Horse Wheel</b>:
                This is just a special case of the whim, namely the use of horses as the source of propulsion.
                Miners not only wanted food and drink, they also wanted a wage, so they were expensive.
                Animals were cheaper, and horses or mules were much stronger, more enduring and worked more or less voluntarily for board and lodging.
                The massive axle and the crossbars needed support so that they did not fall over, and a roof was also fitted to protect the wooden structure and the horses from weather.
                The shape of those buildings was typically conical, so they are easy to identify on old pictures.
                These whims were stationary, but this was not a problem as the mine shaft was also stationary.
                This is why these efficient power machines were so popular in mining.
                This type has a vertical axis.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            The simplest whim simply had a winch, a drum on which the rope was wound, directly on the axle.
            So the turing of the axis wound or unwound the rope directly.
            When switching from pulling up to lowering, the horses had to change their walking direction.
            Moreover, transport was only the second most important task.
            The most important task, pumping mine water, required pumps in the mine, because pumps can only draw up to a height of 10 metres but can pump much higher.
            So the movement to the pump had to be transported down into the mine, either by rotating beams or by moving forwards and backwards.
            There were also pit horses that lived in the mine and drove a winch underground, so the power didn't have to be transported so far.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Over the course of time, the whims got better and better.
            The turning of the wheel, the rotary motion, was first passed to a planetary gear system.
            Then it was transported with moving wooden beams into the mine where the pumps were driven to pump the water.
            If it was used to drive the cage in the shaft, the possibility of reversing the direction was added.
            However, the age of horses ended with the introduction of the steam engine.
            The transport of power via rods was also replaced by decentralized engines, compressed air, hydraulics and electricity.
