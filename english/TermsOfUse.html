                        are logged by the webserver.
                        This data is used by <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span>
                        solely for the optimization of the website.
                        Server statistics are not published.

                    <li>The addresses and emails of the listed sites are already published by
                        the owner and are just collected on
                        <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span>.
                        If - by mistake - private address data is included, we will remove it as
                        soon as possible, if requested.
                        Email addresses are protected by JavaScript which makes them invisible
                        for spammers.
                        As far as we know this protection has not be breached so far, although
                        this is generally possible.

                    <li>Personal data we receive by email or other ways will be kept private, as
                        long as publication is not explicitly requested by the sender.
                        However, we are not able to check if the sender has the right to publish
                        this data, as there is no technical way to identify persons over the
                        internet.
