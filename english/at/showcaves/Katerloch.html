        <p>
            The <b>Katerloch</b> is not a show cave any more, but after being closed for 20 years, it is now open again for small groups.
            Groups between four and ten people may visit the cave after appointment.
            The trips take two hours and are a sort of easy cave trekking tours.
            Cave equipment is not needed, as the stairs and paths still exist, but appropriate clothes and good walking boot are definitely a good idea.
            The guides ask their visitors to be of "appropriate physical fitness".
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Katerloch</b> was named after a bird of prey, the <b>Eulenkater</b>, which is a local owl.
            This gives some reason for misunderstandings, as Kater is the German word for a male cat, and most people think the name means cat’s cave.
            In this case it is a local dialect abbreviation of the owl’s name and thus the cave name means owl’s cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The entrance is a huge open portal, overlooking the Raab river valley.
            The entrance chamber is leading downwards, with debris and dripstones covered by moss.
            The columns are huge, the biggest one is 22&nbsp;m high and has a circumference of 46&nbsp;m, which makes it one of the hugest stalagmites in Europe.
            The biggest chamber is the <b>Fantasiehalle</b> (fantasy chamber) which is 120m long and up to 85&nbsp;m wide.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This cave is extremely beautiful and rich in speleothems.
            Many descriptions include the term "most beautiful cave of Austria" or "most dripstone-rich cave of Austria".
            So a visit is much recommended, despite the high price and the necessity to get an appointment.
            We are not sure if it still is the most beautiful cave (which is also a matter of personal opinion) as there are new discoveries and especially the young Obir show cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Katerloch has been known for a very long time, and its huge cave entrance is hard to miss.
            Despite its remote location, it has been visited time and again, although only in the area around the entrance.
            There are several historical views of the cave, the oldest of which, by <b class="smallCaps">August Mandel</b>, dates from 1837.
            At that time, however, further exploration was prevented by the vertical shafts; the necessary equipment was not available, and even attempts to illuminate the cave with burning tree trunks failed.
            The first serious exploration was carried out by <b class="smallCaps">Adolf Mayer</b> in 1899, followed by a second in 1906.
            He produced very detailed drawings and watercolours.
            In 1908, <b class="smallCaps">Hermann Bock</b> explored the cave and made probably the first survey of the Katerloch.
            Over the next few decades, there were several other explorations and discoveries of side passages, but research was limited due to two world wars.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The situation changed fundamentally when the newlyweds <b class="smallCaps">Hermann</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Regina Hofer</b> came to the Dürntal valley on their extended honeymoon in 1950.
            First, they visited the <b>Grasslhöhle</b> cave and renovated the trails, installed the first electric lighting and cleaned the stalactites sooted by pitch torches.
            They leased the Grasslhöhle and the Katerloch and opened the Grasslhöhle as a shoe cave in 1952.
            This enabled them to finance their research work in the Katerloch.
            In the early 1950s, they made several new discoveries there, which ultimately led to the Federal Monuments Office declaring the Katerloch a natural monument.
            The two often lived for weeks in the hut in front of the cave and in permanent bivouacs in the cave, researching and building stairs to facilitate access.
            Finally, electric lighting was installed and the cave was opened as a show cave in 1958.
            This tour was a real show cave tour, but it required climbing several permanently installed ladders, so it was certainly not suitable for everyone.
            After almost 30 years of operation, the show cave was closed in 1984 by the two, who were already over 70 years old.
            They only offered special tours in exceptional cases.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In the 1990s, Mag. <b class="smallCaps">Fritz Geissler</b> came to the cave and was actually given one of the rare special tours.
            He got on very well with <b class="smallCaps">Hermann Hofer</b>, who introduced him to the cave.
            After <b class="smallCaps">Hofer</b>’s death in 2003, he extensively renovated the tour route, iron stairs, electrical system and infrastructure, and officially reopened the cave in 2004.
            Since then, there are no more iron ladders, and the tour is much easier, but the large elevation gain is still strenuous and the uneven steps require attention.
            For this reason, it is forbidden to bring any bags, smartphones or cameras.
            They must all be left in the cave house at the entrance.
            This is one of the few cases where a ban on photography is actually sensible and understandable.

            <p>
                This is undoubtedly one of the most wonderful caves we have ever visited.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                It is owned by <b class="smallCaps">Herman</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Regina Hofer</b> to whom must go all the credit for the discovery and its subsequent opening as a show cave.
                Before we went underground we heard a tape recording in English telling us what we could, and could not do, in the cave and how all the beauty was really the work of God.
                We were told that this recording had been made in seven different languages for the benefit of foreign tourists.
                Children under 1.5&nbsp;m are not allowed down the cave, neither are people with heart diseases and asthma etc.
                One cannot carry handbags, radios etc and protective clothing is also provided for those who want it.
                Part of the proceeds of this cave go towards further exploration.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The entrance chamber is really huge, about 60&nbsp;m across and at the bottom is a short section of passage leading to the newly discovered section.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                It was then that we realised why there are such stringent regulations governing entry into the cave for we had to descend a 20&nbsp;m iron ladder, and this was not the only one in the cave.
                Still, most of the visitors seem to manage it quite well, even the ladies dressed in their Sunday best!
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Then we began to have some sort of impression of just what sort of cave Katerloch was.
                We soon came into the <b>Hall of Phantasy</b>, 109&nbsp;m deep, 76&nbsp;m wide and 13&nbsp;m high, which is just crammed with the most wonderful stalactites and stalagmites, most of which have united to form columns.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                At the top of this chamber we noted the hole through which <b class="smallCaps">Herman</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Regina Hofer</b> had come in to discover this section of the cave.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                We passed on down this wonderful chamber, fully impressed, but more was yet to come.
                We went down a narrow ladder into a section known as <b>Sea Paradise</b> which consists of a lake about 10&nbsp;m in diameter with a huge pillar standing in it, and this is lit in varying manners to give the most wonderful effects.
                It really was a breathtaking sight, especially with the stern figure of Mr <b class="smallCaps">Hofer</b> narrating the tale of its discovery in the background.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                It is not until one starts to go out again that one fully appreciates the number of steps one has come down and the vast amount of loving work and patience which has gone into making this wonderful show place into something which can be appreciated by the public.
