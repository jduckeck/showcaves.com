        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The <b>Kohlerhöhle</b> (Kohler Cave) is considered the most beautiful gypsum crystal cave in the Alps.
            The cave runs predominantly horizontally, which has led to the strange name <b>layered joint cave</b>.
            In fact, it is located at the boundary between the gypsum of the Werfen layers and the Gutenstein limestone above.
            The cave contains numerous unusual speleothems, both gypsum crystals and stalactites made of calcite.
            Curtains of an unusual red colour are impressive.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave was accessible and therefore certainly known to the locals for a long time.
            It was originally called Kollerhöhle, named after the hill on whose western slope it is located.
            However, a simple wooden fence had probably been in place for a long time to prevent sheep from straying into the cave.
            Nevertheless, it was not visited and only became known to speleologists through the posthumous publication of a note by Dr <b class="smallCaps">R. Willner</b> in the Speläologisches Jahrbuch in 1928.
            They explored it immediately and were impressed by its special features and size, so it was decided to turn it into a show cave.
            The development was carried out by the Annaberg branch of the tourist organisation <b>Die Naturfreunde</b>.
            Wooden walkways were installed, but no lighting, and the narrow passages between the halls were widened.
            Regular guided tours were offered from the Buder inn in Erlaufboden.
            However, these were ended by the Second World War and the paths were no longer maintained.
            The long overdue speleological survey of the cave was not carried out until 1947 by the Lower Austrian Speleological Society.
            The cave was surveyed and a floor plan drawn, and several profiles were also recorded.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is very spacious, obviously a result of the high solubility of the gypsum.
            From the cave entrance you can quickly reach the <b>Fledermausdom</b> (bat dome), which is 50 m long and 25 m wide.
            The name is derived from the fact that several large nests of bats were seen in the ceiling, which apparently hibernated there.
            To the west, the path continues to the <b>Marmorhalle</b> (marble hall), which is about 20 m long and 10 m wide, but is divided into smaller chambers by blocks of stone.
            To the south, the path leads to the <b>Rote Halle</b> (Red Hall), which has a small cave lake at the far end.
            Then you reach the <b>Seehalle</b> (lake hall), which was named after this lake and is about 20 m long and wide and up to 4 m high.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There are several curtains in the cave, which have a reddish or deep red colour, some also have a red-yellow banding.
            There are also stalactites, including some "sinter clubs", an inofficial term for stalactites that thicken at the bottom.
            Larger stalagmites are rarer, but the speciality of this cave are the much rarer sinter formations.
            The <b>Kalkplättchensee</b> (limestone platelet lake) was named after the limestone skins that grow on its surface.
            This form of limestone deposit is well known, but rather rare.
            However, it is noticeable that it mainly occurs in caves with gypsum.
            There are several caves in Lower Austria that have something like this, but this is probably the most spectacular.
            As is usually the case, over time the thin skins grow into calcareous platelets, which can no longer float due to the surface tension and sink to the bottom of the lake.
            The result is a rather peculiar breccia consisting of large calcareous platelets.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This cave has not been a show cave for 80 years, the wooden fixtures have completely disappeared.
            What has remained, however, are the connections between the halls, which were probably originally very low and were therefore extended.
            The result is a cave that is relatively easy to navigate in the area of the former show cave.
            Although it is easy to visit, it does involve some climbing or walking on clay soil, so good equipment, sturdy shoes, warm clothing and lamps are required.
            Until around 2016, the cave was run by appointment by the owner, the owner of the Rußwurmalm on whose land the cave lies.
            However, it is now generally stated that there are no guided tours.
            Nevertheless, the cave has ended up in the Wikipedia list of show caves in Austria, based on a list from the Association of Austrian Speleologists (VÖH) from 2012, when the cave was actually still open.
            In the meantime, the cave is no longer on the lists and the Rußwurmalm is no longer operating.
