            "about": "<div class=\"tiptapped\"><p><strong>Pembroke Castle</strong> was founded by <strong>Roger of Montgomery</strong> in 1093. At this time it was an earth and timber construction, but still it resisted all counter attacks by Welsh forces. In 1189 <strong>William Marshall</strong> transformed it into the enormous stone fortress that we can still see today. But according to legend an Irish bishop had put a curse on <strong>William Marshall</strong>, all his sons would die childless. The line ended and the castle passed into the hands of <strong>William de Valence</strong>, a half-brother of <strong>Henry III</strong>. He became <strong>Lord of Pembroke</strong> through his marriage to <strong>Joan</strong>, granddaughter of <strong>William Marshal</strong>. After the death of <strong>Aymer de Valence</strong>, Pembroke Castle reverted to <strong>Richard II</strong>. It was granted out in a series of short tenancies and as a result began to fall into disrepair. <strong>Owain Glyndwr</strong>, Welsh soldier, patriot and hero, led yet another rebellion against the hated English settlers in 1400. The Constable <strong>Francis а Court</strong> bought off a siege by paying danegeld.</p><p>Finally the castle was not used any more. It was owned by the Pryse family from Gogerddan. It was plundered for stone by the locals and the ruin became a subject of many Romantic paintings. Finally in the 1880s it was leased by the antiquarian <strong>J. R. Cobb</strong>. He restored a part of the castle. In 1928 the castle was bought the local landowner Major-General Sir <strong>Ivor Philipps</strong>. He finally restored the castle to its former glory, which was completed at the outbreak of World War II. His daughter, Mrs <strong>Basil Ramsden</strong>, finally put into a Private Charitable Trust in 1969.</p><p>The most unusual feature of the castle is <strong>Wogan Cavern</strong>, a huge natural cave, beneath the south eastern corner of the castle at sea level. It is accessible via 55 steps from inside the castle. The huge cavern was closed by a massive wall and provided a good storage space. Possibly it has also been used as a boathouse.</p><p><strong>Wogan Cavern</strong> is a natural limestone cave, a karst cave, but it was heavily altered to fulfil the demands of the Medieval castle. Still many parts of the cave remained untouched, like the cave sediments, in which flint tools from the Paleolithic and Mesolithic have been found. It was also used during the Roman occupation of Britain, a Roman coin hoard was found. The were no remains from the Bronze Age, but this probably just means they were destroyed. In the Middle Ages it became an essential part of the castle, which was strategically placed on the Milford Haven waterway. The cave could easily be accessed by a boat to the mouth, so it was probably used as a boat house. Originally outside the castle's defences, it was incorporated during the 13th century with a large watergate being built across the mouth of the cavern. That's why it is also called the <strong>Wogan Watergate</strong>.</p></div>",

            "about": "<div class=\"tiptapped\"><p>The name <strong>Yordas Cave</strong> is derived from the Norse <em>Jord ass</em> or <em>Jörð á</em> which means <em>earth stream</em>. There are many streams in the area, and why this one would be an \"earth\" stream remains unclear. Another legend tells, it is the lair of the infant-devouring Norse giant <strong>Yordas</strong>. We are not the first to wonder how a giant would fit through the relatively small, human sized entrance. However, this story has already been told <strong>John Hutton</strong> by the local guide in about 1780.</p><p>The cave was run as a show cave by its owners in the early part of the 19th century, so it is often described as a <em>Victorian show cave</em>. There are stone steps from this time at the main entrance, leading down into the main hall. Also there are cave descriptions from that time (see links below). But the guided part of the cave was at that time only the main chamber.</p><p>The entrance to Yordas Cave leads directly into the main chamber named <strong>Great Hall of the Giant Yordas</strong>. This is a rather big chamber of 50m by 15m and up to 15m high. There are three small passages leaving this hall to the right and to the left. The smaller second chamber called the <strong>Chapter House</strong> contains a waterfall.</p><p>There is a theory, that many of the places in <strong>Wuthering Heights</strong> by <strong>Emily Brontë</strong> are originally in Yorkshire. If this is true, the most likely place for <strong>Emily's Fairy Cave</strong> would be Yordas Cave. This sounds very likely, as this cave was a rather famous show cave at the time <strong>Emily Brontë</strong> wrote this book. And she attended the Clergy Daughters' School in nearby Cowan Bridge,</p><p>Like many caves in the area this cave is a result of contact karst. Water flowing as a subaerial brook over crystalline, insoluble rock until it reaches the border of the limestone, vanishes immediately underground. In this case they are called <strong>Yordas Pot</strong> and <strong>Yordas Sinks</strong>, where the brook vanishes undergroung in a waterfall. The caving or cave trekking visit of the cave starts at this entrance of the cave with an abseil and a walk through the cave river until it reaches the cave entrance. But even if you do not plan the through trip, the chasm and the waterfall are worth the short hike.</p><p>The cave is on the ground of Braida Garth Farm and private property. Nevertheless it is inside the Yorkshire Dales park and not closed. There is a website which recommends to ask the owner at Braida Garth Farm before entering the cave. We would recommend, not to do this. How would you feel if you work hard and are disturbed several times a day by tourists who want to visit your cave for free? If it were not okay for them, they could simply add a gate. But although permission is not required, please visit the cave respectfully and responsibly.</p><p>It is not possible to visit the cave after heavy rains, as the main chamber may flood up to 2m high. In summer it is normally possible to visit the cave in walking shoes, although wellingtons are recommended.</p></div>",

            "about": "<div class=\"tiptapped\"><p><strong>Devataska Pestera</strong> (Devil's Cave) represents the last stage of cave development, when the cave reaches the surface because of continuing erosion, and it starts to be destroyed by the erosion of the ceiling. An enormous cave passage has numerous roof collapses, so it is actually a series of collapse dolines or a series of natural bridges, depending on your point of view. The cave is called <strong>Oknata</strong> because of the openings, <em>oko</em> means <em>eye</em> in Bulgarian. Another name is <strong>Maarata</strong>, which is actually the name of the river leaving the cave. It forms a valley with waterfalls, rimstone dams, and tufa deposits below the cave.</p><p>The cave has a total length of almost three kilometers. The entrance portal is 35m wide and 30m high, followed by a 40m long passage which leads to a huge chamber. This chamber is between 60m and 100m high and has an area of 2,400m². About 200m from the entrance the passage splits. The right passage is fossil, with an almost rectangular chamber, 50m long and 15m wide, then the passage narrows again and ends in a circular chamber named Altar. The left passage is bigger and waterfilled, the small river is a tributary of the Osam river. Here is also the main hall, with its huge karstfensters. This huge chamber has a flat floor, ascending from one end to the other, and some developments, including a small house built into one of the natural bridges. It is very easy to visit, during daylight hours no lamp is needed.</p><p>The side passages are home to one of the three most important bat colonies in Europe. The cave is frequented by 13 protected bat species, including two species which are considered globally endangered.</p><p>This huge cavern was a fine place for living, allowing sun and warmth to enter while protecting against storm and rain. The cave was inhabited by man during the millennia. Earliest traces of human presence date back to the middle of the Early Stone Age, about 70,000 years BP. The number of artifacts is extraordinarily rich between 8,000 and 6,000 BP, during the Neolithic. It was massively excavated in the early 1950s due to its pending transformation into a warehouse.</p><p>The cave was used as a military site some decades ago, and used for the storage of petroleum. Most of the artificial structures inside the cave are from this era. It seems some cave formations have also been destroyed during this usage. Today the cave is protected as a natural landmark and most of the cave is not accessible. However, it is possible to visit the main passage freely, and one of the openings in the ceiling is used for bungee jumps.</p><p>In 2011 the cave became internationally known when the shooting of the Hollywood action movie <strong>The Expendables 2</strong> took place inside the cave. The shooting was permitted by the Regional Environmental Inspectorate in Pleven, which also granted permission for the construction of settings and a bridge to the cave. However, environmentalists feared that the shooting might have unexpected consequences for the bat colonies. The film production was fined for the removing of some trees at the cave entrance in OCT-2011.</p></div>",

It was developed by the <strong>Prefeitura Municipal de Botuverá</strong> (City of Botuverá) and the <strong>Fundo Nacional do Meio Ambiente</strong> (Ministry of the Environment). The speleological research was done by the <strong>Grupo de Estudos Espeleológicos Açungui</strong>.</p><p>This cave is famous for its wealth of speleothems, including travertine walls, curtains and so-called cauliflower, a boulbous calcite dripstone. The cave has no river, which is generally a drawback for the amount of troglobiont species living in the cave. Nevertheless 35 species of invertebrates, among them 6 endemic species, were found in the cave. Seven species of bats live in the cave.</p></div>",

            "about": "<div class=\"tiptapped\"><p>The cave of Bom Jesus is a natural limestone cave at the foot of a 90m high white limestone cliff. It is a huge chamber which is 50m long, 15m wide and 7m high. Nearby is a second cave named <strong>Soledade</strong>, which is even larger. Several smaller caves are also integrated into the sactuary, housing small side chapels. The top of the cliff shows very impressive karren, more than a metre deep, almost a stone forest. The cave houses the whole church, only the belfry was built in front of the cliff.</p><p>The cave was discovered by the Portuguese <strong>Francisco Mendonça Mar</strong> in 1691. Like his father he worked as a goldsmith and painter. In 1679, in his early twenties, he arrived in Salvador da Bahia and opened a workshop. In 1688 he was commissioned to paint the palace of the Governor General of Brazil in Salvador. But instead of receiving payment he was taken to jail and cruelly flogged. When he was finally released he was convinced, that the only thing which counts is salvation. He gave away all his posessions and accompanied by an image of the crucified Christ he traveled inland. He walked all the way, starved and suffering in the heat of the sun, and surrounded by cannibalistic Indian tribes. After several months of walking, he saw a hill in the afternoon sun. He climbed the steep slope and entered a cave, placed the cross he was carrying, and began a life as a hermit.</p><p>After some time he realized that love for God alone was not enough. He started to help the the poor, the sick, the unhappy, and the lame. He did not make any difference between Portuguese and native Indians. At the request of the Archbishop of Bahia, Dom <strong>Sebastião Monteiro de Vide</strong>, he went to Salvador to prepare for the priesthood. He studied for three years, from 1702 to 1705, and was finally ordained a priest. He took the name Father <strong>Francisco da Soledade</strong> and returned to Lapa where he lived until his death in 1722.</p><p>The Sanctuary of Bom Jesus da Lapa is the cave, where <strong>Francisco</strong> had placed his cross. The characteristic item of the pilgrims are the straw hats, coated with white fabric and colored ribbons. The white is symbolizing hope. The season for the pilgrims starts right after the feast of St. John, intensifies from the 28th of July, and culminates on the 6th of August with the feast of Bom Jesus. The Sanctuary is visited by over 2.5 million pilgrims per year.</p></div>",

            "about": "<div class=\"tiptapped\"><p>The <strong>Gruta do Bacaetava</strong> (Bacaetava Cave) is located at the Parque Municipal Gruta do Bacaetava. As you probably mentioned, it is owned and operated by the municipality Colombo. The cave is a river cave and is entered through the resurgence of the cave river. The trail along the river is sometimes only a dirt path because it is flooded regularly. Some bridges across the cave river are removable, so they can be removed before the flood.</p><p>The small park is well equipped with visitor center, video room, environmental education room, bathrooms, a religious cave, as well as a recreational space with kiosks and barbecue grills. Especially the so-called religious cave, a small shrine resembling the Lourdes grotto, is pretty impressive.</p><p>The guided tours start at the Visitor Center, groups of up to 20 people first see an introductory video, the every participant gets a torch and the walk to the cave starts. The tour includes a 140m walk to the cave and 170m inside the cave, then the tour returns the same way. The cave is entered upstream and the trail follows the main river passage. The rest of the cave and the fossil upper layer are not developed.</p><p>The area has many immigrants from Italy, which came to Brazil in the 19th century. The cave was actually discovered by such an Italian immigrant, <strong>Antonio Gasparin</strong>, who owned the land. He told frieds about the cave and soon it became quite popular. We are not sure how the discoverer named the cave, but today's name is not Italian, its the Tupi-Guarani word for “pierced stone house”. It is pronounced <em>Bacaitava</em>. During World War II Brazil declared war on faschist Italy and the Italians in the country were being persecuted. They used the cave as a hiding place. Brazilians also hid in the cave, they fled the Brazilian army to avoid being recruited for the war.</p><p>After the war <strong>Antonio Gasparin</strong> donated the land to the Mother Church of Colombo, probably an explanation for the Lourdes grotto. So it became the property of the Santa Casa de Misericórdia in Colombo. But the undeveloped cave suffered serious degradation due to more than a century of unsupervised visitation. Finally in 2000 the city of Colombo bought the cave from the church and created the Municipal Park Gruta do Bacaetava. They resurveyed the cave, wrote a management plan, and developed the cave with trails and infrastructure. The site is now part of the <strong>Circuito italiano de turismo rural</strong> (Italian Rural Tourism Circuit) of sites with a connection to the Italian immigrants.</p></div>",
