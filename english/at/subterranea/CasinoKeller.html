        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The <b>Casino Keller</b> was an ice cellar used by a local brewery and also by people living in this quarter for storing all kinds of food and beer.
            So it was widely known and the building where it is located below is called Café Casino, although the cafe is closed for years now.
            This kind of cellar is called <i>Grieblkeller</i> in the local dialect, which means it normally was located in the quarter on the right side of the river Traun, which was called <b>im Gries</b> or <b>im Griebl</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This part of the city has a different geology than the city center, which is built on the loose rubble deposited by the river.
            The rocks on the right side are more solid clastic sedimentary rocks formed much earlier, deposited by an ancient version of the Traun river 120.000 years ago.
            Conglomerates and sandstones were rather soft and comparably easy to mine and build the cellars.
            Nevertheless the rock was stable to hold up even without using wooden frames.
            The porosity of the rock regulated the humidity inside the cellars, so it was ideal for the stored goods.
            And finally the ground is high enough to avoid the frequent floods caused by teh rising riving Traun during snw melt and after heavy rains.
            Many cellars were dug at this location and used for vegetables and potatoes and other food which required cool and humid storage.
            And the most interesting thing: the cellars were dug horizontally into the Siriuskogl, the rocky outcrop behind the houses.
            As a result ist is possible to drive into the cellars with carts and today with cars.
            This made the transport of the goods much easier.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            in 1466 the town Ischl was granted the <i>Marktrecht</i>, the right to hold markets, which was important thing as the people sold goods in the town.
            The town earned taxes and it produced income from dealers and buyers staying at hotels and eating in restaurant.
            But the problem was that there was not enough storage room for all the goods, and unfortunately there was the danger of floods in the town center.
            As a result a lot of cellars were built for the storage of goods in the Griebl, which had above geologic advantages, was above the flood zone, and still inside the <b>Burgfriedsgrenze</b>, the border of the town.
            Many houses in this area had cellars cut into the soft rock, but this cellar was exceptional, as it was by far the biggest and intended to store beer for a brewery, not only the vegetables of the owner.
            It was owned by the <b>Ischler Brauerei</b> and called <b>Bräu Griebl Kellerhaus</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Ischler Brauerei</b> went bankrupt after centuries, with the introduction of cooling machines for breweries in 1908.
            As a result the cellar and the building above were sold and the new owner opened the <b>Cafe Casino</b> with a cafe in the ground floor
            The first floor was a dance hall with a bar named <b>Teddy-Bar</b> serving cocktails.
            Not only the waiter had a tie, it was also mandatory for the guests.
            There was a small stage for live bands and guest could retreat into a separee.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            After many years the cafe was finally sold in 1971 to <b class="smallCaps">Josef Schmalnauer</b>.
            He was a singer and had traveled many countries, and he bought the cafe to realize his dream of becoming the singing landlord of Ischl.
            While he was singing, playing guitar, and entertaining the guests, his wife waited, and soon the cafe was even more popular than before.
            His program was quite entertaining with a mixture of local folk, pop songs, shanties, stories, and jokes.
            His friends called him <i>Boart Sepp</i>, boart is the local dialect for beard and Sepp the short form of Josef.
        </p>
