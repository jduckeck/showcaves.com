            Croatia lies between the Julian Alps in the north-west, the Pannonian Plain in the east, and the Adriatic coast in the south.
            The Dinarian mountain range covers its central region, with heights up to 1,830m asl.
            The country has nearly 56,000 square kilometers and a population of 4.5 Million people.
            The Capital is Zagreb with 800,000 inhabitants.
            The official language is <b>Croatian</b>, locally called <b>Hrvatski</b>.
            The local name of the country is <b>Republika Hrvatska</b> or just <b>Hrvatska</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The country was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until World War I.
            In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia.
            After World War II Croatia became a part of the communist Yugoslavia of <b class="smallCaps">Tito</b>.
            The country declared its independence in 1991, but it was occupied by Serb armies, and it took several years of war and the intervention of the UN to clear the country from this armies.
            Today the country is more or less safe and especially the coastal areas are again popular travel destination.
            Its also possible to visit the rest of the country, but because of remaining land mines it is important to stay on the road.

        <p>
            The caves and karst features in Croatia are so much a part of the landscape and integrated in the life of the locals for many thousand years.
            The first records on caves in Croatia date back to 1096.

            1775 <b class="smallCaps">Ivan Lovriæ</b> described Gospodska Špilja near Sinj.
            He is said to be the first cave explorer of Croatia.

        <p class="indentedText">
            At the moment there are 11,500 known caves in Croatia, but several areas were
            never systematiucally searched for caves, so the amount must be much higher.
            Many caves do not have natural entrances, about 1,000 caves were discovered
            through road works.

1887th to 1930th Members of the Rijeka Mountaineering Club (1885 Club Alpino Fiumano, after 1919 Club Alpino Italiano-Sezione di Fiume) explored speleologically in the Croatian coast, Gorski kotar and Istria and explored more than 200 caves and pits. In 1887, they explored the Asparagus Cave near Kastav and later arranged it for a tourist visit and protected it with a door.

1887 Duro Pilar made the first true topographic draft of the cave on millimeter paper (the Great Cave at Medvednica).

1892 Geologist Mijo Kišpatić founded the Committee for the Arrangement of Barač Caves in Rakovica .

1898 HPD begins to publish the journal Croatian Mountaineer, in which articles on speleology have been published in large numbers.

1898 Dragutin Hirc published in Gorski Kotar the first drawing showing the exploration of a cave - the Hyde House. The drawing was made by painter Vaclav Anderle.

1899 The Liburnia Mountaineering and Tourism Association was founded in Zadar , and in 1900 its cave section (section) , whose members explored caves in the surrounding area. In 1903, they organized the first Croatian speleological expedition With a cutter through the Kornati Islands, and in 1908 a Committee for Cave Research.

1910. Due to Dragutin Gorjanović Kramberger, a Cave Research Committee was established in Zagreb in the Geological Commission of the Kingdom of Croatia and Slavonia . It is the first professional speleological association.

1911 In Split, Professor Umberto Girometta founded the Cave Department at Velika Realka and with the students explored the caves and caves of Dalmatia. In the Cave and Cave of Central Dalmatia, published in 1923, Girometta gives an overview of the main characteristics of 472 caves and caves and discusses their morphological and genetic characteristics. In 1927, at his urging, a Section for the Investigation of Karst Phenomena (now the HPD Mosor Speleological Section) was established, thus continuing the tradition of the "cave" from the Great Realka .

1912 Dragutin Gorjanović Kramberger first uses the term speleology in the Journal of the Geological Commission for Croatia and Slavonia.

1922 Geologist Josip Poljak defended his doctoral dissertation with a topic in speleology. He was the first to scientifically investigate the Veternica cave in 1934.

1923 Umberto Giromettadescribed as many as 472 speleological phenomenain the work of the Cave and the Cave of Central Dalmatia .

In 1925, Italian cavers descended into Ponor near Raspora on Ćićarija and measured a depth of -450 m, which is when the cave was declared the deepest in the world. However, by measuring the cave more accurately in 1974, Croatian cavers measured a depth of only -355 m.

1949 A speleological section was founded at the Zagreb PD(initiated by Vladimir Redenšek). Subsequently, speleology in Croatia is experiencing a major upswing. Speleological sections were established in other mountaineering societies and speleological activity was initiated at the Geological Institute and the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Today, there are about forty speleological associations operating under two umbrella speleological organizations in Croatia.

1954 The Croatian Speleological Society was founded.

1955 A research institute was founded at the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts called the Geological-paleontological collection and karst laboratory , or the Institute for Paleontology and Geology of the Quaternary (since 1974), in which academician Mirko Malez made a significant contribution to scientific research within the Quaternary geology and speleology.

1956 The Speleology Commission of the Croatian Mountaineering Association was established.

1957 The first speleological course in Ogulin is organized. The following are speleological courses in the Lower Cerovačka Cave in 1958 and in Toun in 1960. The organization of speleological schools according to the program of the Speleology Commission began in 1966, and since the founding of the Zagreb Speleological School in 1971, they have been organized almost every year in Zagreb, Split, Karlovac, Šibenik and other cities.

1987 Detailed investigations of the cave system Đulin abyss-cave Medvedica under the city of Ogulin were completed, which until 2011 represented the longest Croatian cave with a total horizontal channel length of 16 396 m. ancient times. The first research was conducted by Josip Poljak (1926) and Mirko Malez (1956-1957), and detailed research was carried out by members of the Speleological Section of the PDS Velebit under the leadership of Marijan Čepelak from 1984 to 1987.

1993 The first speleological expedition of the Croatian Mountaineering Union Speleology Commission to the Lukina jama-Trojama cave system in the Northern Velebit National Park. Expeditions continued in 1994 and 1995. The cave system Lukina jama - Trojama was explored to a depth of 1392 m, which ranked it 9th in the list of the deepest caves in the world, and today it is the deepest cave in Croatia and next to the second deepest in the Slovak cave (1320 m deep, explored). between 1996 and 2002) among the twenty deepest in the world. The discovery of Lukina jama begins a new period in the exploration of deep caves in Velebit, which continues with the discovery of a third Croatian cave more than a thousand meters deep, the Velebit Cave System (-1026 m) discovered in 2003, in which research is still ongoing.

1998 The  Croatian Speleological Association was founded. Today in Croatia, associations that are registered for speleological activity (speleological and mountaineering) operate within the Speleology Commission of the Croatian Mountaineering Association or the Croatian Speleological Association.

2009 The Istrian Speleological Association was founded.

2011 The Zagreb Speleological Association was founded as a regional organization that brings together speleological associations in the area of ​​the City of Zagreb and Zagreb County.
