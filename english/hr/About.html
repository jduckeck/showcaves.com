        <h1 class="center">Croatia - About the Country</h1>

        <p>
            Croatia lies between the Julian Alps in the north-west, the Pannonian Plain in the east, and the Adriatic coast in the south.
            The Dinarian mountain range covers its central region, with heights up to 1,830 m asl.
            The country has nearly 56,000 square kilometers and a population of 4.5 Million people.
            The Capital is Zagreb with 800,000 inhabitants.
            The official language is <b>Croatian</b>, locally called <b>Hrvatski</b>.
            The local name of the country is <b>Republika Hrvatska</b> or just <b>Hrvatska</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The country was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until World War I.
            In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia.
            After World War II Croatia became a part of the communist Yugoslavia of <b class="smallCaps">Tito</b>.
            The country declared its independence in 1991, but it was occupied by Serb armies, and it took several years of war and the intervention of the UN to clear the country from this armies.
            Today the country is more or less safe and especially the coastal areas are again popular travel destination.
            Its also possible to visit the rest of the country, but because of remaining land mines it is important to stay on the road.
        </p>

        <p>
            The caves and karst features in Croatia are so much a part of the landscape and integrated in the life of the locals for many thousand years.
            The first records on caves in Croatia date back to 1096.
            In 1536 <b class="smallCaps">Petar Zoranić</b> wrote about the Velebit and Dinara caves.
            In 1584 <b class="smallCaps">Nikola Gučetić</b> wrote the first scientific paper on speleology.
            1775 <b class="smallCaps">Ivan Lovriæ</b> described Gospodska Špilja near Sinj.
            He is said to be the first cave explorer of Croatia.
            1922 the geologist <b class="smallCaps">Josip Poljak</b> received the first doctor’s degree in speleology.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At present, 11,500 caves are known in Croatia, but some areas have never been systematically searched for caves, so the number of caves has to be much higher.
            Many caves do not have natural entrances, about 1,000 caves were discovered through road works.
