      <p>
         <b>პრომეთეს მღვიმე</b> (Prometheus Cave) was opened as a show cave in 2011 and is the youngest show cave in Georgia.
         The cave was visited by the President of Georgia <b class="smallCaps">Mikheil Saakashvili</b> in 2010.
         He suggested the new name of the cave, because there is a local legend that <b class="smallCaps">Prometheus</b> was chained to the mountains in this area.
         So the cave was renamed and is now known as Prometheus Cave.
         According to the Greek mythology, <b class="smallCaps">Prometheus</b> stole the fire from the gods and gave it to humanity.
         He was punished with eternal torment, bound to a rock, an eagle was sent to eat his liver.
         His liver grows back overnight, only to be eaten again the next day.
         After some versions of the legend he was bound at Mount Elbrus (100 km) or at Mount Kazbek (160 km) in the Caucasus Mountains.
         So that’s not really close to the cave.
         Actually there is a Georgian Epic about <b class="smallCaps">Amirani</b>, who resembles the classical Prometheus.
         In this legend <b class="smallCaps">Amirani</b> was chained to the Khvamli rock where birds would eat his organs.
         This rock is only 16 km from the cave, so it would have made more sense to call it <i>Amirani Cave</i>.
         Obviously a president is right, even if he is wrong.
      </p>

      <p class="indentedText">
         The cave tour shows Argonauts Hall, Kolkheti Hall, Medea Hall, Love Hall, Prometheus Hall and Iberia Hall.
         They say that 6 out of 22 chambers are developed, which is such an absurd claim, we had to cite it.
         The weird sentence "The caves feature spaces — referred to as halls — of varying depth and width" is quite funny.
         There is also a cave river, and visitors can pay an additional fee to leave the cave by boat.
      </p>

      <p class="indentedText">
         <b>ყუმისთავის მღვიმე</b> (Kumistavi Cave) was discovered, named, and explored in 1983 by a group of Georgian speleologists.
         <b class="smallCaps">Jumber Jishkariani</b> led the team, which consisted of <b class="smallCaps">Tamaz Kobulashvili</b>, <b class="smallCaps">Amiran Jamrishvili</b>, <b class="smallCaps">Vakhtang Kapanadze</b>, and <b class="smallCaps">Kote Nizharadze</b>.
         The cave is part of a large cave system in a karst area which is named <b>Sataphlia-Tskaltubo karst massif</b>, north of the city Tskaltubo.
         After a few years the cave was generally called <b>ღლიანის მღვიმე</b> (Tshaltubskaya, Cave of Tshaltubo), after the nearby city.
         Because of the difficulty to rewrite the russian name in Latin letters it is also written Tsqaltubo or Tskaltubo.
         It was never renamed, people just started to use the other name in publications, and it stuck.
         Even the placemark at the resurgence on Google Maps uses this name.
      </p>

      <p class="indentedText">
         The development of the cave as a show cave started in 1985, only two years after its discovery and exploration.
         After the works were going on for more than a year, the trail was already completed, the project was stopped due to financial problems.
         They claim that the political situation after the Soviet Union collapsed was responsible, the Soviet Union collapsed between 1989 and 1992, the cave development was stopped in 1990.
         The cave development was postponed for 17 years, but while the cave was closed for the normal tourist, there was a possibility to visit it even during those years.
         Numerous tour operators offered cave trekking tours into the cave, which actually entered on the abandoned trails to go beyond into the undeveloped part of the cave system.
      </p>

      <p class="indentedText">
         In 2007, with increasing tourism in Georgia, the cave development was restarted.
         The development was financed by the government and was obviously intended to create an attractive destination for tourism.
         In spring 2010 the reconstruction of the road to the cave was started, and the most spectacular feature of the new cave was created, a light system based on state-of-the-art LED lights.
         The system was built and installed by the German company <b>GermTec</b>, which is specialized on LED light systems for show caves.
         Unfortunately the cave light is coloured, which is - even with the most modern technology - quite annoying.
         In the same year the President visited, and the cave was renamed, and only one year later it was finally opened to the public.
         Today there is a Visitor Center with a museum, a restaurant, a hotel, and numerous other venues, which developed around the most popular natural monument destination of Georgia.
         The cave is visited by 100,000 to 200,000 visitors per year, so we guess it’s essential to avoid Holidays and weekends.
      </p>

      <p class="indentedText">
         As we said there is a cave river.
         Actually there are two resurgences, which meet immediately after the spring and form ყუმისთავი (Kumistavi) river.
         On the western side is the resurgence of the lower level of Prometheus Cave, with a small artificial lake and a jetty where the boats from the cave land.
         On the eastern side is the <b>ღლიანას მრვიმე</b> (Ghliana Cave).
         The cave is not developed, and an active river cave which has a huge 4 m high and 7 m wide portal.
      </p>

      <p class="indentedText">
         The cave has parking lots and a visitor center at the road.
         After purchasing tickets, the visitor enters a huge doline behind the building.
         The cave entrance is located at the bottom of this doline.
         After leaving the cave on the other end, either a small bus or a sort of "tourist train" brings the visitors back to the cave entrance which is about 500 m northeast.
         At the cave exit there is no parking but there is a huge hotel named Tskaltubo Epic Hotel & Spa.
         The city Tskaltubo has dozens of spas, it has springs with thermal water between 33 °C and 35 °C.
         The limestone rich water also contains radon and is said to heal circulatory, nervous, musculo-skeletal, gynaecological and skin disease.
