        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Chua Tien</b> is
        </p>


        <!--
        Chua Tien which means "Pagoda of Fairies", was built during the reign of Le
        Thanh Ton (1460-1497) in a small cave found in an elephant-shaped mountain. The
        pagoda is located south of Lang Son town, half a kilometre from Ky Lua bridge. A
        mountain emerges from the surrounding rice fields, with red brick houses cuddled
        together on the steep, rocky-covered slopes. The scenery is half-real,
        half-mystical, with clouds covering the tops of the hills. From the first
        moment, they set foot on the mountain, the traveller is taken aback by the
        circling, snake-like paths leading to the cave. Every year, when spring arrives,
        CuÃ¯a Tien opens its gate to welcome pilgrims from all corners of the country.
        They come here to pay tribute to the fairies, to visit the scenic spot and to
        say prayers. Having walked up the 64 steps and passed the main entrance, the
        traveller is struck by the sight of a 400-year-old bonze bell. It is 0.80 m
        high, 2 cm thick and has a diameter of 0.40 m. On the wall near the bell are
        four Chinese characters "Dai Tuong Phat Tich" and 12 large and small epitaphs.
        The beautiful handwriting must be that of Ngo Thi Si (1726-1780), a famous
        scholar under the reign of Le Hien Ton. In the middle of the cave, there are 12
        statues. Behind the 12 statues, one can see on the wall five Chinese characters
        "Song Tien Dong Co Doanh" (meaning "Ancient Cave of the Twin Fairies"). The
        characters incised there are too beautiful to be real. The Song Tien cave
        consists of three areas: in the middle is the Tam Bao temple worshipping the
        arhats, on the right is a temple worshipping Tran Hung Dao, the great national
        hero underNha Tran who defeated the Mongol invaders, and on the left is a temple
        worshipping Thanh Mau (Mother Goddess) and the souls of deceased Buddhist
        believers. The legend goes that once upon a time, a male fairy was reigning over
        the Dai Tuong mount. One year, the surrounding area was affected by severe
        drought, and the soil was scorched and nothing could be grown. The people had to
        endure a lot of hardship and misery. Moved by the people's untold suffering, the
        old male fairy disguised himself as a beggar and wandered through all the
        corners of region. When he arrived at this arid spot, he met with a group of
        children. He played with them awhile, then inquired after their plight. Then he
        told the children to close their eyes. He thumped his foot on the ground and
        vanished into thin air. The children opened their eyes to find in front of them
        a well full of water. Since then, the villagers have not worried about a lack of
        water. And they called the well "Tien Well". A temple was erected to pay tribute
        to the fairy. There is another legend about two fairies playing chess. They were
        so absorbed in the game that they became stone. Hence the name "Twin Fairies".
        Now, in the middle of the cave ,you can see the statue of an old man with a
        white goatee, his head bent forward as if he was thinking of a move. (VNS)
