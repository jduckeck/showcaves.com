        <h2>Description</h2>

        <div class="foreignText">

            <p>
                The Candelaria Caves are located in the limestone hills, 10km west of
                Raxruj&aacute; where the R&iacute;o Candelaria goes underground.
                Reputed to be 22km long, with five entrances, they are thought to be the longest
                cave in Latin America.
                Typical passage widths are 20-30m with a height of 10-60m, with numerous karst
                fensters caused by collapse.
                One truly monumental chamber is the 200-metre-long <b>Tzul Tacca</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The cave was considered by the ancient Maya to be the entrance to the underworld
                of <b>Xibalba</b>, and the cave contains archaeological sites.
                The <b>Q'eqchi' Maya</b> still come to pray in the Candelaria Caves.
                It is said that the <b>Lacandon Maya</b> (living in Mexico, just west of the
                border with Guatemala) believe that every night the sun is carried in a basket
                by the Dioses del Mundo Subterraneo through a long cave from west to east, to
                emerge again at daybreak.
                Perhaps the Candelaria Cave is the nocturnal pathway of the sun!

                Text by <b class="smallCaps">Tony Oldham</b> (2004).
                With kind permission.
            </p>

        </div>

        <br>


        <p>
            The <b>Candelaria Caves</b> lie in the east-west running <b>Cuchumat&aacute;n
            Mountains</b>.
            The Cretaceous limestone are intensively folded and form a rugged landscape with
            many caves and sinkholes, covered with dense tropical forest.
            Most rivers of this area flow into <b>Usumacinta River</b>, which runs north,
            forming the border between Guatemala and Mexico.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            North of the village <b>Chisec</b> the <b>Candelaria River</b> emerges the first
            time, winds through the valley for a few kilometers and then enters the <b>San
            Simon Hills</b> near the village <b>Candelaria Camposantos</b>.
            This is the begin of the <b>Candelaria Caves</b>, a complex system of impressive
            caverns and passages, located inside enormous jungle-shrouded karst towers.
            The passages are huge, typical widths between 20 and 30m, heights between 10 and
            60m.
            The largest chamber is 200m long, 200m wide, and up to 60m high.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Between <b>Candelaria Camposantos</b> and <b>San Antonio de las Flores</b>, on a
            distance of about 13 kilometre, the river reappears six times in poljes
            <a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../explain/Karst/Polje.html"><img class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Explain.png" alt="Explain"><b>poljes</b></a>
            or between
            <a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../explain/Karst/TowerKarst.html"><img class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Explain.png" alt="Explain"><b>karst towers</b></a>,
        thus forming seven different caves which are all together called Candelaria Caves.
        The number seven is exceptional, and so it is logical to assume some kind of
        connection between the old Mayan religion and the cave.
        Major rituals did actually take place at Candelaria Caves, which probably
        involved bloodletting and large audiences.
        The Kings of Cancu√©n did not need artificial pyramids, they had natural
        ones: the karsts towers with suitable caves connecting to the underworld.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            However, the interpretation of the caves as the site of the mythical <b>Tulan
            Zuyua</b> by <b class="smallCaps">Daniel Dreux</b> seems to be a lure made up
            for the tourists.
            <b>Tulan Zuyua</b> is mentioned in the <b>Popol Vuh</b>, the K'ichee' equivalent
            of the Bible.
        </p>

        <br>

        <div class="center">
            "Tulan Zuyua, Seven Caves, Seven Canyons is the name of the Citadel.
            Those who were to receive the gods arrived there."
            <br>
            Popol Vuh, Part 4
        </div>

        <br>

        <p>
            Tulan means city, and Tulan Zuyua is the city Zuyua which was supposedly much
            older and far grander than any Toltec town.
            It is generally agreed, that it was located at Teotihuacan, northeast of
            Mexico City.
            Beneath the <b>Pyramid of the Sun</b> at Teotihuacan lies a natural cave whose
            main shaft and side chambers add up to seven.
            Nevertheless the Candelaria Caves are dubbed <i>Sacred Mayan Caves</i> in
            tourist brochures.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The touristic development of the caves was made by <b class="smallCaps">Daniel
            Dreux</b>, a French speleologist and explorer, who explored caves in the area
            since 1966.
            In 1974 he participated on a Guatemalan-French expedition and explored
            Candelaria caves.
            In 1984 he returned and started to build a hotel.
            The whole story is rather strange, as the land was probably owned by the state
            at that time, and he bought the right to use 0.75 ha of land from a farmer.
            Around the year 2000 he had a hotel with an area of 22ha and controlled 12km of
            the 13km of underground river passage in Candelaria caves.
            Living in France, he runs a tourist business, bringing French tourists to the
            hotel during August and December, who tour the caves and other nearby tourist
            sites.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The whole story is rather strange, as there is no legal base of his business.
            It seems, <b class="smallCaps">Dreux</b>, as self-appointed owner and savior of
            the caves, became a little egocentric at last.
            He did not allow modern Mayan rituals or access to the caves to non-French
            scientists including Guatemalans.
            The growing self assurance of the indigenous people resulted in the claim to own
            the land and the caves.
            The communities of Candelaria Camposantos, San Miguel Sechochoc, and Muq'b'il
            Ha' received their land titles on the 29-OCT-2002 and now manage it in
            co-administration with the Ministry of Culture and Sports.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            For a foreigner it is really hard to decide, what the true situation is.
            On one side, <b class="smallCaps">Dreux</b> did the touristic development,
            brings guests, work and money to the country, and protects the cave.
            There was neither a government nor locals who did much development, but now
            <i>"locals"</i> who moved in during the last decade, try to take over his
            business.
            On the other side he never owned anything, capitalised on the obscure political
            situation, does his best to keep all the money, does not respect the religion of
            the locals, does not allow non-French scientists in the cave, and
            <i>"protects"</i> the cave only if this does not interfer with his business.
            At the moment he ignores the legal rights of the true owner and still manages
            his business as before.
            We are not sure what implications this might have for his guests.
            Probably the government will shut down his business in the near future, which
            could be rather bad for his guests.
            It would to be better to visit the caves with the legal owners, but we could not
            find any information on their offers on the web until now.
            However, foreigners generally travel guided and do not have the chance to decide
            which offer they take, they have to follow their guide.
