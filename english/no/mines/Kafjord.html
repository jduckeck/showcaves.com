        <h2>Geology</h2>

        <p>
            K&aring;fjord lies in the so-called <b>Alta-Kv&aelig;nangen bedrock window</b>,
            with Jurassic sedimentary, some 200Ma old, surrounded by the typical crystalline
            rocks of Norway.
            The sedimentrary rocks contain numerous ore deposits, the largest just above the
            ore-dressing plant in K&aring;fjord.
            Deposits were found in an area of up to 10km from K&aring;fjord.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The ore was found in lodes which consisted of quartz and calcite, with smaller
            quantities of the ores pyrite and chalcopyrite.
            The ore was separated by crushing which raised the copper content to 4-5%.
        </p>


        <br class="clear">


        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The copper ore near K&aring;fjord, on the hills above, was mined during the 19th
            and early 20th century.
            The copper ores were discovered by <b class="smallCaps">John Rice Crowe</b> on a
            visit to Trondheim in 1824.
            In the following year he returned with the cornish mining expert <b
                class="smallCaps">Joseph Michell</b>, who examined the strata of greenstone on
            both sides of K&aring;fjord.
            He found veins containing limestone, quartz, chalcopyrite, and pyrite.
            Pyrite is iron ore and chalcopyrite copper ore.
            As a result <b class="smallCaps">Crowe</b> applied for a permission to mine and
            smelt the ore, which was granted by the crown in 1826.
            The <b>Alten Copper Mines</b> were founded as a co-operative society between <b
                class="smallCaps">A. F. Nellen</b> and the <b class="smallCaps">Ward</b>
            brothers with 80 shares and <b class="smallCaps">Crowe</b> and <b
                class="smallCaps">Woodfall</b> with 40 shares.
            The mining in K&aring;fjord began on 01-JUL-1826 with 11 men from R&oslash;ros.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The main mine was found by a Sami girl from Dullan in Kafjord, named <b
                class="smallCaps">Marit Aslaksdatter</b>.
            She had found rocks of a strange colour on the mountain above Str&oslash;msnes,
            and showed them to the merchant <b class="smallCaps">Klerck</b> in Bossekop.
            he was the local agent of <b class="smallCaps">Crowe</b> and <b
                class="smallCaps">Woodfall</b>, and so the <b>Big Mine</b> started.
            <b class="smallCaps">Marit Aslaksdatter</b> was rewarded in 1834 with a small
            pension for life.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The location of the works at K&aring;fjord is very favourable.
            There is the fjord, which is ice-free all year, and big ships can come as close
            as 100m to the storage area.
            There are two small rivers providing enough power for the crushing of the ore.
            The copper works operated all year round and provided a lot of jobs for the
            area.
            In 1840 K&aring;fjord copper works was the largest iron and copper works in the
            country with 651 employees.
            Miners from other mines in Skandinavia and Great Britain were recruited and the
            infrastructure for the workers and their families built.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The mining started to crumple in the 1850s, when the copper price was rather low
            because of competition from Cuba and Australia.
            Then they introduced new techniques to produce high quality copper, which
            improved profatibility.
            But in the 1870s finally the operations at the copper works ended.
            1873 the smelting wos closed, the workforce was continually reduced, and finally
            in 18778 the operation was closed down.
            Most workers emigrated to America, a few stayed to work at the slate industry or
            to run a farm.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Mining resumed after the Swedish Consul <b class="smallCaps">Nils Persson</b>
            purchased the disused K&aring;fjord copper works in 1896.
            It was named <b>Alten's Copper Mines</b> and mining started with 60 mineras in
            1897.
            In 1900 it was again the sixth largest mine in the country, based on the
            manpower.
            But soon the older mines were exhauseted and the operation was no longer
            profitable.
            So the works were finally closed in 1909.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The copper works are just ruins, and there is no museum, but a trail through the
            surface remains equipped with information plates has been laid out.
            Th trail is 1.2km long and starts at the E6 at the parking lot.
            Then it leads along the fjord to the church.
            The church was built in 1837 in the style of an English village church, a
            remider of the English owners.
            It is also the only building of the town which was not burned down during World
            War II.
