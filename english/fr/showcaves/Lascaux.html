            The <b>Cave of Lascaux</b> is famous for its prehistoric paintings showing
            various animals, hunts, and wars.
            They were discovered by four local boys on Thursday 12-SEP-1940.
            This is the official date of discovery and generally agreed on.
            But the story behind is told in many different versions.
            Here is one of them, which is told in a popular childrens book from the 1950s.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b class="smallCaps">Marcel Ravidat</b> was walking his dog <b
                class="smallCaps">Robot</b> in the woods surrounding Montignac.
            The dog discovered a hole in the ground and crawled in, to search for its
            residents.
            The boy heard a whine and the dog was gone, when he crawled into the hole
            carefully, he discovered a drop, obviously the dog had fallen down into a bigger
            cave.
            He alarmed three friends, <b class="smallCaps">Jacques Marsal</b>, <b
                class="smallCaps">Georges Agnel</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Simon Coencas</b>,
            and together they climbed down the drop and rescued the dog.
            When <b class="smallCaps">Ravidat</b> explored another drop at the end of the
            cave, which turned out to be a dead end, he turned around and saw an
            extraordinary picture on the wall.
            It was a sketch of a man who was probably killed during a hunt.
            The picture was extrordinary, so they told their teacher, <b
                class="smallCaps">Leon Laval</b>, about their discovery.
            He was so impressed that he wrote Abbe <b class="smallCaps">Henri Breuil</b>, at
            that time the most famous French archaeologist.
            <b class="smallCaps">Breuil</b> explored the cave for years and published his
            work internationally.
            Soon the cave became world renowned, was developed as a show cave and in 1948
            opened to the public.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Other versions tell, that the boys were looking for a treasure in the area,
            which was told about in old legends.
            Some say the dog never fell in, but discovered the entrance four days before, on
            08-SEP-1940, and the boys returned four days later to explore the cave.
            Others say the dog had nothing at all to do with the discovery.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Lascaux is often called the <b>Sixtine Chapel of Prehistory</b>, because of its
            wealth of pictures.
            1,500 engravings and 600 drawings have been documented.
            They have been dated to be 17,000 years old, and are often dubbed the oldest
            artworks of mankind and the begin of art.
            This sounds good, but is obviously nonsense.
            Of course, Lascaux is one of the most outstanding painted caves, but since the
            1940s numerous other caves have been discovered, both older and younger.
            Such an elaborated work of art does not come into existence from one day to the
            other.
            Probably there were thousands of similar paintings outside the cave, which are
            now destroyed by weathering, and only a small amount - which was protected by
            the cave - still exists.
            At least there must have been a culture which allowed the creation of the
            pictures, some kind of social system which allowed the painters to concentrate
            on painting while others were hunting.
            However, the oldest art known at the moment are human figures carved into ivory,
            which were found in southern Germany and were dated to be about twice as old.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There is a very interesting fact about the drawings: the hunts were drawn on the
            wall like a <b>comic strip</b>.
            The story of the hunt goes from the left to the right, until the prey is
            captured.
            <b>These pictures were obviously used to tell stories</b>.
            And they may be called the oldest known comic books!
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The first chamber is called the <b>Chamber of Bulls</b>, and is probably the
            most impressive section with numerous animal paintings on the walls, most of
            them bulls.
            The artists were carefull not to cover older pictures with the new one, which
            otherwise was rather common.
            The oldest paintings here are 17,000 years old and painted in a single colour,
            either in red or in yellow.
            The <b>Great Bull</b> is the center of the chamber, a 5.50m long picture which
            is the largest painting in the chamber.
            The cave contains many pictures which simply depict animals, but a few are
            extraordinary, either with an extremely rare motive or so enigmatic that it is
            not clear what was depicted.
            On of this kind is the <b>Unicorn</b>, an animal with unusually large
            hindquarters, a pronounced abdomen, and two straight elongated horns protruding
            from the head.
            There is a sort of optical trick, when the head is viewed from a certain angle
            it resembles a human face.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Chamber of Bulls is followed by a passage with a sequence of red cows, which
            show various aspects of perspectivity.
            This passage leads to <b>Chamber 3</b>, which once contained hundreds of
            paintings, but the walls above ground were destroyed over the millennia by
            erosion.
            Only the lower part of the wall, which was protected by the debris, is
            preserved.
            And it shows an impressive number of 209 figures, 122 horses, 25 wild oxen, two
            bison, four ibex and a large number of abstract shapes.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Nave</b> was named so because of its dome like shape, which resembles a
            cathedral.
            The rock is yellowisch and softer, thats why the passage widens and it also
            allowed the creation of engravings.
            At the left side of the entrace seven ibex look towards the chamber.
            Remains of colour make clear that they once were painted too, but the colour was
            destroyed and only faintly scratched outlines remain.
            A main artwork of this section are the <b>Fighting Bison</b>, two exaggerated
            bison which seem to be in conflict, and colored strokes are interpreted as
            detached rear legs, probably as a sign of death.
            Similar concepts were found in other caves.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This is the end of the former show cave, the following passage called <b>Gallery
            of the Great Cats</b> has never been open to the public.
            The narrow passageway is only a metre wide, it is the most secret part of the
            cave with pictures intended to be viewed by one person at a time.
            Beneath the engravings of caves it shows the portrait of a bison, a shape
            resembling the roman numeral XIII, and then a line of red dots.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The paintings are not really very fragile, but their long endurance was a result
            of the natural climate of the cave.
            Black colour is charcoal, red and brown colors are various clays.
            Paintings with such pigments may bleach slowly from ultraviolet light or be
            washed down from rain water, but both does not happen in caves.
            In caves the humidity and the low temperature keeps the paintings extremely
            stable and preserves them.
            And a cave is a very low energy environment, so there is very little food for
            any kind of life, which means that there are no biogene threads to the
            paintings.
            Nevertheless several paintings were destroyed by layers of rocks falling off the
            walls, taking the paintings on the surface with them.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But the high amount of visitors - up to 2,000 per day - raised the temperature,
            changed humidity, brought in dust and seeds of plants, and changed the chemistry
            of the air.
            One result was dramatically increased deposition of calcite on to of the
            paintings, called <b>maladie blanche</b> (white sickness) because of the white
            colour of fresh calcite.
            The thin calcite originally protected the paintings, but becoming too thick it
            went opaque.
            Another problem was the light, it bleached the paintings and caused the
            growth of plants, especially algae, an effect called <b>lampenflora</b>.
            This was called <b>maladie verte</b> (green sickness), because of the green
            colour of the plants.
            The negative effects of the visitors on the paintings was first discovered in
            1955 and as a result the authorities closed the cave in 1963 to protect the
            paintings.
            Climate control equipment was installed inside the cave and in the mid 1970s the
            situation was under controll.
            Temperature and humidity were stable again and even a very limited amount of
            visits was possible, fiver persons per day for about 20 minutes each.
            The calcite was not removed, but did not grow further, the plants died after the
            light was off, and the green colour vanished by decomposition.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            To allow the visitors to see the cave paintings anyway, an exact facsimile
            called <b>Lascaux II</b> (faux Lascaux or fake Lascaux), was built just 200m
            from the original cave.
            In <b>Lascaux II</b> two galleries have been reproduced: the <b>Chamber of
            Bulls</b> and the <b>central corridor</b>.
            This two parts of the Lascaux cave show the majority of the paintings, about 96%.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The construction of the replica was a chance for scientists, to prove their
            knowledge how the paintings were made.
            Inside a shell in reinforced concrete, with the contours of the cave inside, the
            paintings were executed in the same manner, using the same types of materials
            believed to have been used 19,000 years ago.
            This were natural pigments like ochre, charcoal, and iron oxides.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Unfortunately this is not the happy end of the story.
            After decades during which the situation had stabilized, things went bad very
            fast.
            In 2008 the United Nations made an urgent appeal to France to take action to
            preserve the paintings.
            The dramatic worsening of the situation started in 2000, when the management
            started to replace the climate control equipment inside the caves.
            It is unclear why this was necessary, but it is clear that all protocols were
            violated during the work and the installed machinery was not working as
            intended.
            Workers were entering and leaving all the time, the roof over the entrance was
            removed, and for the work a high energy light system was installed.
            The renovation was completed in MAY-2001, and at the same time the first patches
            of white fungus were discovered.
            The walls were soon covered in a layer of white mould, at the end of the summer
            white patches were covering huge areas of the wall.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The outbreak of the fungal infection of <i>fusarium</i> covered the walls and was
            fought by antibiotics, anti fungal substances and by manual removing.
            All those methods are problematic, as touching the paintings may destroy them as
            well as spraying chemicals on them.
            And it pollutes the environment.
            Additionally the fungus may become resistant.
            However the paintings were covered with cotton which was then sprayed with
            special fungicids, specifically designed to destroy this fungus.
            The results were promising, the fungus reduced, after two years the measures were
            reduced and the situation seemed stable.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            However, the new air conditioning was not redesigned, and the materials
            introduced into the cave during the installation were not removed.
            The biogene material is the base of the fungus growth and its removing would
            stop the growth, unfortunately this is virtually impossible.
            The modern sensors of the air conditioning were not able to regulate the work of
            the air condition, because the humidity is always 100% underground.
            The old air conditioning removed an excess amount of water without regulation,
            but the humidity was still the natural 100%.
            In order to control the new air condition with electronic humidity sensors, the
            humidity was reduced to 95%.
            Several other changes were made, for example an internal door, the remains of an
            air lock of the 60s was removed.
            The resulting changes in the cave climate had very unfortunate effects.
            In 2006 black spots appeared on the wall, another sort of fungus, which does not
            grow at 100% humidity, but very well at 95%.
            It incorporates melanine, the pigment which is responsible for the suntan in
            human skin.
            Unfortunately this dark stain will stay, if the fungus is killed by fungizides.
            So the damage which already happened will be almost irreversible this time.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The end of this story is open, at the moment it seems to us that the paintings
            will be mostly destroyed in very few years.
            The UNESCO sees this similar, in 2008 it told the French government, which is
            responsible for the protection of this French World Heritage site, to ensure
            the protection of the painitngs.
            Otherwise the site will be listed on the red list of endangered WH sites.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In 2008 British scientists dated the paintings with the U/Th method for the
            first time.
            Before only the carbon of the charcoal in the paintings was used to determine
            the age of the paintings using the C14 method.
            Obviously this works only for the black parts of the paintings, which consist of
            charcoal.
            Uranium decays to thorium and this process happens in any kind of sinter
            deposit, if there is a trace of uranium.
            This method measures the uranium and thorium content in flowstone crusts which
            grew on top of the painting.
            As a matter of fact this method only gives a minimum age, but it is usable also
            for engravings and paintings without charcoal.
            The results are astonishing: parts of the artworks are between 25,000 and 35,000
            years old.
