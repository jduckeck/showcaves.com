        <h2>Description</h2>


        <div class="foreignText">

            <p>
                Descending the pass between the Esperou and Lingas mountains one enters
                the Hérault Gorge. Just past Ganges the Grotte de Demoiselles (Fairies
                Cave) is to be found. The original entrance to this cave was at the top
                of the hill, but with a touch of engineering genius, the owner bored a
                180m long tunnel from the cliff face, half way up the hill at an angle
                of 45°. The spoil from the tunnel was used to make an extensive terrace
                car park. An electrically assisted rock railway takes one up to the
                natural cave.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                A series of narrow, winding passages, 6 to 10m high leads to the <b>Upper
                Entrance</b>. The guide then prepares visitors for the <b>piece de
                resistance</b> of the trip, an enormous chamber called the Salle de Vierge
                (The Virgin's Hall) which measures 86m across and is 52m high. The
                tour is cunningly planned, going first to near the bottom of the chamber,
                then upwards towards the roof, then around the chamber, in and out of the
                formations, and finally returning to the starting point. Our guide was a
                real comedian, and at one stage of the tour he began to beat out a turn
                on some formations. He and the audience became very engrossed in the
                rhythm, and when he had finished he was met with loud, enthusiastic
                applause, the man should take his act to an agent.

                Based on an article in <b>The British Caver</b> Vol 58 1972 by <b class="smallCaps">Jim Smart</b>.

            </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            A technical highlight of the cave tour is the <b>funicular</b>.
            The tour starts at the cave entrance on the foot of an impressing cliff.
            The funicular goes up 51.5m into the cave.
        </p>

        <div class="foreignText">

            <p>
                In former centuries strange creatures could be seen on the Plateau du Thaurac.
                The farmers of the area often saw strange things in white clothes around a well
                known cave entrance.
                One of these farmers named <b class="smallCaps">Jean</b>, who had seen the
                creatures himself, decided to find out where they were coming from and what they
                were doing.
                He was obviously braver and more curious than the others.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Jean entered the cave in the evening at sundawn.
                First he did not deiscover anything and after some hours he bacame tired.
                He said down and fell asleep.
                At midnight he awoke by bright white light and saw a woman who held a child on
                her arms.
                She tells him to follow her, and he obeys.
                But he falls into a deep pit where he passed out.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                After some time, he did not know how much, he came out from his unconsciousness.
                But now the whole scene had changed.
                The big chamber was lighted in red, producing light reflections which run down
                the stalagmites like blood.
                It seems like molten metal is standing in the pools.
                On a huge pedestal the woman with the child stood, around her nearly naked women
                dancing with open hair.
                The sounds of loughing devils is coming from the dark places of the cave.
                A deep roaring was sounding up from a deep pit.
                Again he passed out.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The next day <b class="smallCaps">Jean</b> is found in the cave by friends.
                After they brought him back to consciousness, he tells this story.
                So the cave was named <b>Bauma de las Fadas</b> (Cave of the Fairies).
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Old Legend.
            </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            Obviously this story does not tell about the fairies known from fairy tales,
            good beeings fulfilliong wishes.
            This fairies are like bad witches, and mangle with the devil.
            A little strage is, that they did not harm Jean, he just fell into a pit.
            And from the modern viewpoint one would say he becamefearful in the dark cave,
            did not watch his steps, fell down a shaft and became halucinations because of
            his heavy injuries.
            Msot likely he banged his head.
        </p>
