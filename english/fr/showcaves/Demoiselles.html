        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The <b>Grotte des Demoiselles</b> is a large cave located near Saint-Bauzille-de-Putois in the Hérault valley.
            The entry to the cave is at the foot of the southern cliff of the Massif du Thaurac.
            This region is known amon wine enthusiasts as <b>terraces of the Larzac</b> and well known for its wine.
            A technical highlight of the cave tour is the <b>funicular</b>, which goes up 54 m into the cave through a 160 m long 36% inclined tunnel.
            Thus visitors avoid to climb 300 steps to reach the level of the cave passage.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The first chamber contains a photo of an reassembled skeleton of a <b>cave bear</b> (<i>Usus spelaeus</i>) which was discovered during the development in 1929.
            The skeleton is at the Montpellier University.
            The cave has numerous speleothems which seem to be quite old.
            An attempt to date them resulted in an age of nearly 700,000 years for the concretions that formed on the stalagmites and columns.
            Or in other words, the the concretions which grew on the existing and thus older stalagmite are 700.000 years old.
            The cave is obviously even older, because the floor existed as it is today when the massive speleothems started to grow.
            An exceptional shawl or drapery can be seen, which iscalled <b>The Royal Coat</b>.
            It was named by <b>André Breton</b>, the famous French writer leader of the surrealist movement, in one of his books, <b>L'amour fou</b>.
            He compared it to the coat of a Hawaiian chief, sparkling under the spotlights!
            A column or stalagnate cane be seen, with a circumference of 16 m.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tour descends to the impressive <b>Cathedral</b>, the biggest chamber which is 120 m long and 52 m high.
            After the tour through the cave you return to the funicular.
            Visitors who want to walk the staircase can do so downwards on the way back if they want.
        </p>

        <div class="foreign">

            <p>
                Descending the pass between the Esperou and Lingas mountains one enters the Hérault Gorge.
                Just past Ganges the Grotte de Demoiselles (Fairies Cave) is to be found.
                The original entrance to this cave was at the top of the hill, but with a touch of engineering genius, the owner bored a 180 m long tunnel from the cliff face, half way up the hill at an angle of 45°.
                The spoil from the tunnel was used to make an extensive terrace car park.
                An electrically assisted rock railway takes one up to the natural cave.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                A series of narrow, winding passages, 6 to 10 m high leads to the <b>Upper Entrance</b>.
                The guide then prepares visitors for the <b>piece de resistance</b> of the trip, an enormous chamber called the Salle de Vierge (The Virgin's Hall) which measures 86 m across and is 52 m high.
                The tour is cunningly planned, going first to near the bottom of the chamber, then upwards towards the roof, then around the chamber, in and out of the formations, and finally returning to the starting point.
                Our guide was a real comedian, and at one stage of the tour he began to beat out a turn on some formations.
                He and the audience became very engrossed in the rhythm, and when he had finished he was met with loud, enthusiastic applause, the man should take his act to an agent.

                In former centuries strange creatures could be seen on the Plateau du Thaurac.
                The farmers of the area often saw strange things in white clothes around a well known cave entrance.
                One of these farmers named <b class="smallCaps">Jean</b>, who had seen the creatures himself, decided to find out where they were coming from and what they were doing.
                He was obviously braver and more curious than the others.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Jean entered the cave in the evening at sundown.
                First he did not discover anything and after some hours he became tired, he sat down and fell asleep.
                At midnight he awoke by bright white light and saw a woman who held a child on her arms.
                She told him to follow her, and he obeyed, but he fell into a deep pit where he passed out.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                After some time, he did not know how much, he came to his senses again.
                But the whole scene had changed, the huge chamber was lighted in red, producing light reflections which run down the stalagmites like blood.
                It looked as if the pools were filled with molten metal.
                On a huge pedestal the woman with the child stood, around her almost naked women dancing with open hair.
                The sounds of laughing devils is coming from the dark places of the cave.
                A deep roaring was sounding up from a deep pit.
                Again he passed out.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The next day <b class="smallCaps">Jean</b> was found in the cave by friends.
                After they brought him back to consciousness, he told this story.
                So the cave was named <b>Bauma de las Fadas</b> (Cave of the Fairies).
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Old Legend.
            </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            Obviously this story does not tell about the fairies known from fairy tales, good beings granting wishes.
            This fairies are like bad witches, and mangle with the devil.
            Quite strange is, that they did not harm Jean, he just fell into a pit.
            And from the modern viewpoint one would say he became fearful in the dark cave, did not watch his steps, fell down a shaft and became hallucinations because of his heavy injuries.
            Most likely he banged his head.

        <p class="foreign">
            A shepherd was looking for a lost lamb who wandered into the swallow hole that marked the entrance to the cave.
            He heard the lamb but could not see it, and so he continued deeper and deeper into the cave, until he reached the chamber now known as the cathédrale (cathedral).
            With only a torch for light, he slipped and fell to the bottom of the chamber, a 60-metre plunge.
            Knocked senseless by the shock, he noticed — just before passing out — a group of young ladies dancing and singing around him.
            When he woke up, he was back on the surface with his lamb.
