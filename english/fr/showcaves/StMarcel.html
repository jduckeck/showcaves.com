            The cave is entered through an 80m long adit, which brings the visitors right into the middle of the huge main passage.
            This passage winds downhill, and has an diameter of about 40m.
            The first and most spectacular sight are the rimstone pools.
            Water running down the slope of the passage forms sinter, first with small gours, then continually growing.
            Today there are a hundred huge pools, with rims more than a metre high and less than 20cm thick.
            Now the path follows the bend of the passage and down an iron stair into the last chamber, which is full of speleothems.
            The tour includes a sort of multimedia spectacle at this point.
            The speleothems are explained with classic music and light effects.
            After this short rest, we have to climb up the same way we came in.
            This is a bit strenuous, but the beautiful cave compensates for this hard work.

            This is the normal tour of the cave, which was the only tour some years ago, and it was a normal guided tour.
            However, the tours were completely refurbished some years ago.
            The classical tour is now called <b>Visite libre</b> (Free tour) and is now self guided.
            Tours start every 15 minutes and the participants walk independently.
            There are information panels and guides are present on the course to answer all questions.
            Guided tours are not offered at all currently due to Covid-19.
            The <b>Visite épicurienne</b> (epicurean tour) is actually the same tour but with an additional wine tasting.
            After the one hour cave tour a white wine and a red wine from the Saint-Marcel d'Ardèche region are tasted with a guide who is also oenologist.
            Wine is obviously only served for adults, so there is an additional fee for adults, while children pay the same fee as for the regular tour.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The other tours are cave trekking tours of various levels of difficulty.
            The <b>Aventure en Famille</b> (Family Adventure) is a good introduction into caving for children, and for adults who have never done caving before.
            It allows the visit of undeveloped passages but and the tour tells the story of a drop of water and its journey underground.
            The other tours are real caving tours into various parts of the caves, with narrow parts, climbing and sumps.
            Participants are equipped with caver suit, helmet, headlamp, and wellingtons.
            We suggest to bring clothes to change, a plastic bag for the dirty clothes, gloves, and a towel.

            The cave is today called Grotte de Saint-Marcel d'Ardèche, because the land where the natural entrance is located was a donation from Dame Vierne in 1228 to the town of Saint-Marcel.
            But this was 600 years before the cave was discovered.
            The opening is high above the river Ardeche and in the middle of a steep cliff, until today there is no comfortable trail to the entrance.
            It was discovered in 1836 by a hunter from Aiguèze who climbed through rather inaccessible wilderness in search of a rabbit he had wounded.
            As he had no lamp he was not able to enter and explore the cave.
            After the discovery the cave was first named <b>Grotte du Grand Louret</b>.
            It took two years until he returned with some friends, equipped with torches and ropes, to explore the cave.
            They explored the huge main passage to some extend and returned to Aiguèze as heroes describe the immensity of the cavity and the richness of the concretions.
            As a result other loacls visited the caves, and as always souvenirs were taken home.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            And then something quite exceptional for the 19th century happened.
            The mayor of Saint-Marcel d'Ardèche, the Marquis <b class="smallCaps">de Bernis</b>, decided by decree in October of the same year to close the cave, to put an end to the destruction and protect the cave.
            Only two visits per week under the guidance of a guide approved by the town hall were allowed.
            The strict conditions of the tours were: no bag, torches or Bengal lights allowed, 6 people maximum per visit, servants, boatmen or valets were not allowed to accompany the group.
            This was quite exceptional and unprecedented, and it took 150 years until caves were again treated with so much care.
            Today such concepts are quite popular again.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave was known under various names, like <b>Grottes du Bois Cayrelenc</b> and <b>Caves des Pendants de l'Ardèche</b>.
            And finally, between 1870 and 1880, the cave was named <b>Grottes de Saint-Marcel d'Ardèche</b>.
            But the number of visitors dwindled and the cave was closed for several years.
            The cavers <b class="smallCaps">Albin Mazon</b> and <b class="smallCaps">EA Martel</b> explored the cave and it was finally reaopened in 1882, following business rules based on their observations.
            At this time the cave was developed for tourism with ladders and trails and became a real show cave.
            After it was declared an Natural Monument in 1934 it was operated by the <b>Syndicat d’Initiative de St-Marcel et de la Basse Ardèche</b> since 1935.
            They offered tours for a fee of 1 franc per visitor, and planned to do a massive modernization and development of the show cave.
            But the global economic crisis and World War II interrupted any development.

        <p class="indentedText">
            At the same time the exploration of the cave system was mostly done by <b class="smallCaps">Robert de Joly</b>.
            But there was a collapse of the passage called <b>Grande Barrière</b> (Great Barrier), which made further exploration impossible.
            <b class="smallCaps">Robert de Joly</b> mentioned the possibility to the army, that the cave could be used as a shelter and ammunition storage.
            As a result they financed the tunneling through the barrier with explosived.
            After this was done under the supervision of <b class="smallCaps">Robert de Joly</b> the army obviously realized that a cave which is not very well accessible is a poor chioce, they abandoned the project.
            But the cavers were able to continue the exploration and the length of the cave increased to 3260m.

            The modern age of the show cave and mass tourism in the Ardèche started in 1962 with the construction of the Gorges Tourist Route.
            The road made numerous sites accessible by car and was built right across the cave.
            An old shelter was transformed into a bar-restaurant in 1964, run by <b class="smallCaps">Jean Bernoux</b>, known as "Bouboule"
            The <b>Groupe Spéléo de St-Etienne-Forez</b> was founded in 1966 and they rented the old forest house 1967.
            But it was in the 1980s when the municipality of Saint Marcel, led by <b class="smallCaps">Pierre Sabatier</b>, decided to open the cave to the general public.
            It was necessary to access the cave from the road, without the need to walk through the limestone cliffs.
            For this a 122-metre long access tunnel was built right beneath the road into the main passage.
            This part of the cave was developed with trails, electric light and a light show.
            The natural entrance was gated to protect the archaeologic excavations.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Cavité de la Tête du Lion</b> (Lion's Head Cavern) was discovered in 1963.
            It contains rock paintings which are almost 20,000 years old, dated by C14 from the charcoal of the torches used by the artists.
            The paintings show a bovid drawn in red ocher and two deer heads.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The entrance portal, where the cave passage was opened by the Ardeche Gorge, was open for a long time.
            It was used by Neanderthals between 90000 and 40000 BC.
            Bones, tools, pruning waste, and the remains of butchered animals was discovered.
            There was also a human presence during the Mousterian period, but not during the Upper Paleolithic.
            Later the cave was again visited, during the early Neolithic and the Bronze Age.
            A menhir and a dolmen were erected near the cave and inside the entrance a sheepfold was installed.
            The discovery of barley and wheat grains suggests that the cave also served as a grain store during the Upper Neolithic.
            After the Bronze Age no remains could be found, the entrance was probably blocked.
