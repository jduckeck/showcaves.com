        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Grotte de Lombrives</b> is located at the eastern edge of the Pyrénées Ariégeoises Natural Regional Park, inside a limestone mountain named Cap de la Lesse (1190m asl=.
            It is part of a cave system which is in total 14km long and has three main entrances, Niaux and Sabart in the Vicdessos valley, Lombrives in the Ariège valley.
            The cave system has two main levels, the upper level around 650m asl and the lower level around 550m asl.
            The levels are connected by numerous vertical shafts.
            Although Lombrives is close to numerous painted caves, it does not have any cave paintings.
            During an excavation by <b class="smallCaps">Félix Régnault</b> in the late 19th century Neolithic remains were found.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave entrance is located high on the hillside, about 1.4km from the ticket office.
            To reach the cave visitors can either walk or take the mini-train for a small fee.
            Quite funny: the ride downhill is free!
            Tours booked online give the time of arrival at the ticket office, the actual cave tour starts 30 minutes later at the cave entrance.
            The starńdard tour takes two hours, together with the train ride you should plan three hours.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is entered though a huge portal.
            The tour follows the main main passage to the <b>Cathedral Chamber</b> which is 80m high.
            To make this size easier to understand for cave visitors, the guides tell the story that the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris, which would fit into the chamber.
            Obviously nonsense, as the spire of the church is much higher and the nave is much longer than the chamber.
            But obviously, one should not question such claims.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is quite infamous for absurd statements.
            The old cave website was full of exaggerations, including being the <b><i>largest cave in Europe</i></b>.
            They stated the cave was 39km long with seven different levels, while it is actually 8 kilometer long with two different levels.
            The statement was modified now and then, so it was sometimes the largest show cave of Europe, or it was the largest cave of France.
            And there was the claim that the cave was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
            Finally, they even celebrated the 25th anniversary of the entry and expected representatives from Guinness to join the celebrations.
            The origin of this nonsense is rather simple: Guiness once listed a few long caves of France, the list with half a dozen caves out of thousands contained Lombrives, and actually Lombrives was the longest of this arbitrary subset.
            The next step is obvious: the cave management believed their cave was the longest caves.
            And they shamelessly used this and other nonsensical superlatives for advertising purposes.
            Strange was also that their website and tours were available only in French.
            Spain is only 25km away, but they did not offer a single line in Spanish or any other language.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            However, since 2019 or 2020 the management has changed, there is a completely new website, the exaggerations were removed and now the guides do at least a short explanation in English.
            But still numerous websites with fantastic reports about the biggest cave of Europe and its Guinness World Record exist on the web.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            And the time of stupid stunts is obviously not over.
            In 2021 a group of 40 people spent 40 days inside the cave for a research how humans react without natural light and day rythm.
            The <b>Deep Time</b> experiment was organized by French-Swiss explorer <b class="smallCaps">Christian Clot</b>.
            However, it seems the execution of the experiment was at least dilettante, and its use rather low.
            For one, such experiments have been made several times in the 20th century, so new discoveries are unlikely.
            Also the experiment should have been conducted as a double-blind trial to provide reliable results.
            But it was criticized that the experiment was conducted without a meaningful strategy.
            And finally it was absolutely unnecessary to use a cave for this experminet, any bunker, cellar, or even a windowless laboratory would have been more efficient.
            To do this in a cave is obviously just marketing.
        </p>
