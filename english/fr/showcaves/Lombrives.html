        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Grotte de Lombrives</b> is located at the eastern edge of the Pyrénées Ariégeoises Natural Regional Park, inside a limestone mountain named Cap de la Lesse (1190m asl=.
            It is part of a cave system which is in total 14km long and has three main entrances, Niaux and Sabart in the Vicdessos valley, Lombrives in the Ariège valley.
            The cave system has two main levels, the upper level around 650m asl and the lower level around 550m asl.
            The levels are connected by numerous vertical shafts.
            Although Lombrives is close to numerous painted caves, it does not have any cave paintings.
            During an excavation by <b class="smallCaps">Félix Régnault</b> in the late 19th century Neolithic remains were found.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave entrance is located high on the hillside, about 1.4km from the ticket office.
            To reach the cave visitors can either walk or take the mini-train for a small fee.
            Quite funny: the ride downhill is free!
            Tours booked online give the time of arrival at the ticket office, the actual cave tour starts 30 minutes later at the cave entrance.
            The standard tour takes two hours, together with the train ride you should plan three hours.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Lombrives cave is entered though a huge portal.
            The tour follows the main passage to the <b>Cathedral Chamber</b> which is 80m high.
            To make this size easier to understand for cave visitors, the guides tell the story that the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris would fit into the chamber.
            Obviously nonsense, as the spire of the church is much higher and the nave is much longer than the chamber.
            But obviously, one should never question such claims.
            The chamber is the result of a drop, a waterfall of the underground river.
            To continue the trail must ascent along the wall of the chamber to reach the higher level of the passage behind the chamber.
            The tour ends at an underground lake.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            One of the cave formations was dubbed <b>Grave of Princess Pyrene</b> after the legend.
            There are actually dozens of versions of this legend, but all have in common that the Pyrenees were named after a princess named <b class="smallCaps">Pyrene</b>.
            She didn't actually care, because at this point of the story she was already dead.
            Hence the "grave" part of the name.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave actually has a long history of human visits, starting in the Magdalénien.
            The first remains of this age were excavated by <b class="smallCaps">Félix Régnault</b>, as mentioned above.
            Then the cave was used during the Bronze Age as a burial site, the grave of a man was excavated.
            Nevertheless, the visits were obviously rather sparse.
            This changed during the Middle Ages, which is quite exceptional as most people of those times feared caves.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Cathars</b>, a Christian dualist or Gnostic movement between the 12th and 14th centuries, was ended by Pope <b class="smallCaps">Innocent III</b> through the <b>Albigensian Crusade</b> in 1209-1229.
            It ended with the defeat of the Cathars, they were persecution by the Medieval Inquisition, which finally succeeded in eradicating them by 1350.
            During this century many caves were used by the Cathars as hideouts, cave castles or <i>Splugas</i> were used as strongholds, and Lombrives has its share of Cathars related visits.
            In 1244 the Cathar bishop <b class="smallCaps">Amiel Aicard</b> was hiding in the cave after the fall of the nearby castle of Montségur.
            According to legend he brought the treasure of the Cathars, which was hidden in the cave.
            A rather annoying legend, it caused destruction in the cave by treasure hunters of later centuries.
            They were obviously not aware that the most valuable posession of the Cathars was knowledge, so it might have consisted of books, and the humidity of the cave must have destroyed them in months or years.
            Later <b>Huguenots</b> used the cave for the same purpose, also priests and nobles during the French Revolution, and Republicans during the First Empire.
            It also served as a shelter for hermits, lepers, simple shepherds, brigands and counterfeiters.
            As far as we know all those visits are legendary, there were actually no remains found.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            However, early cave "tourists" left a trace.
            The main gallery has a section with a flat and dry wall, and was used by visitors during history to leave their names.
            The oldest are from the 12th century, most are probably from the 19th century.
            The most famous is the future king of France <b class="smallCaps">Henri IV</b>, who visited the cave in 1578.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave offers two different cave trekking tours, one for children and one for adults.
            Participants are equipped with helmet, headlamp, and other necessary gear and explore the mostly level and huge passages.
            This tours follow the regular path to the cave cave lake and from here undeveloped passages are visited.
            And finally there are numerous events, like concerts and dinners with music inside the cave.
            There is also an event similar to an <i>escape room</i>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Lombrives is quite infamous for absurd statements.
            The old cave website was full of exaggerations, including being the <b><i>largest cave of Europe</i></b>.
            They stated the cave was 39km long with seven different levels, while it is actually 8 kilometer long with two different levels.
            The statement was modified now and then, so it was sometimes the largest show cave of Europe, or it was the largest cave of France.
            And there was the claim that the cave was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
            Finally, they even celebrated the 25th anniversary of the entry and expected representatives from Guinness to join the celebrations.
            As far as we know this never happened, and there actually never was a cave record concerning Lombrives.
            The origin of this nonsense is rather simple: Guinness once listed a few long caves of France in the French edition, as background info to the records.
            The list with half a dozen caves out of ten-thousands contained Lombrives, and actually Lombrives was the longest of this arbitrary subset.
            The next step is obvious: the cave management believed, their cave was the longest.
            And they shamelessly used this fallacy and other nonsensical superlatives for advertising purposes.
            Strange was also that their website and tours were available only in French.
            Spain is only 25km away, but they did not offer a single line in Spanish - or any other language for that.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            However, since 2019 or 2020 the management has changed, there is a completely new website, the exaggerations were removed and now the guides do at least a short explanation in English.
            But still numerous websites with fantastic reports about the biggest cave of Europe and its Guinness World Record exist on the web.
            An the road signs to the cave still have <i>La plus vaste grotte d'Europe</i> on them.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            And the time for silly marketing stunts is obviously not over yet.
            In 2021, a group of 15 people spent 40 days inside the cave to explore how humans react without natural light and daily rhythms.
            The <b>Deep Time</b> experiment was organised by French-Swiss researcher <b class="smallCaps">Christian Clot</b>.
            However, the conduct of the experiment seems to have been amateurish to say the least, and its outcome rather insignificant.
            For one thing, such experiments have already been carried out several times in the 20th century, so that new discoveries are rather unlikely.
            Also, the experiment would have had to be conducted as a double-blind experiment to provide reliable results.
            It has also been criticised that the experiment was conducted without a meaningful strategy.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Our personal opinion is: cave expeditions spend many days underground without exploiting this in a media-friendly way.
            They actually do research, surveying and scientific investigations while they are underground.
            And not only do they pay the costs themselves, but they do it in their spare time, because speleologists are enthusiasts.
            How about funding such expeditions instead, collecting data on a broad basis, not just in a spectacular but singular experiment.
            This project has no speleological benefit and only uses the cave as a marketing tool.
            It was absolutely unnecessary to use a cave for this experiment, any mine, bunker, basement or even a windowless lab would have been much more efficient and much cheaper.
            Doing this in a cave is obviously just marketing at the expense of nature.
        </p>
