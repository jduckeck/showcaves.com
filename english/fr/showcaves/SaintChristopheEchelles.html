        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            We have listed the <b>Grottes de Saint-Christophe</b> since 2024, which is not because they are a new show cave.
            Actually the show cave exists since the late 19th century, but it was named <b>Grottes des Echelles</b>.
            There are two caves, so the plural is rightful, the name <b>Grottes des Échelles</b> was derived the next city Les Échelles, which is 3 km to the southwest.
            The english translation Caves of the Ladders is sometimes used, but it makes no sense, they are named after the city, not after ladders.
            They are also called <b>Grottes de Saint-Christophe</b> after the nearby village Saint-Christophe-sur-Guiers, which has less than 500 inhabitants living in several hamlets.
            The hamlet which is right below the cave has a dozen houses and is called <b>La Grotte</b> or <b>Saint-Christophe-la-Grotte</b>, after the cave.
            So you can see there is a complicated number of names, nevertheless there was actually no reason for a name change.
            Unfortunately they changed the name in 2022 officially to <b>Grottes de Saint-Christophe</b>.
            This name change took years, it started with a new domain in 2016.
            And it is a rather poor decision, first all the old literature and numerous webpages still use the old name, so it is quite difficult to find info on the cave.
            And second, there are numerous sites which are already named after Saint <b class="smallCaps">Christophe</b>, he's a popular Saint after all, and so the confusion increases.
            And third, though that's not their fault: when we designed <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span> we decided to use the name of the cave as the name of the html file for the cave.
            So our urls are a sort of breadcrumbs, starting with the language, then the country, the type of entry, and finally the name as filename.
            This works pretty well, except when a site is renamed, which is fortunately extremely rare, for obvious reasons.
            So we had to rename our page, change the sort order in any list, and even update the poi.
            We realized the name change in 2024, so the new page with the new url exists since 2024, and that's finally the explanation why we have listed the cave since 2024.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There is an escarpment, a limestone ridge, which is part of the southern outskirts of the Alps, called the <b>Chartreuse massif</b>.
            A narrow gorge cutting through this escarpment, forms a natural way to cross the mountain ridge.
            The gorge and the caves developed in the Lower Cretaceous limestone, which is called <b>Urgonian</b> in France.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The first who used this special location were the <b>Romans</b>, who built their road, the major route between Chambéry and Lyon, through the gorge.
            Today the Roman road is only a minor road, little more than a comfortable footpath, but still some Roman remains are left, like the impressive <b>Saint Martin's Bridge</b>.
            Between 1667 and 1670 the <b>Dukes of Savoy</b> converted the already ruined Roman road into a royal road fit for carriages.
            A monumental, 400 m long dressed stone ramp was built.
            Also, the <b>Charles Emmanuel II Monument</b> was erected in 1674, to commemorate the man behind the road development project.
            The 20 m high monument is listed in the national register of Historical Monuments.
            According to the cave guides the monument was more expensive than the construction of the road.
            The <b>Voie Sarde</b> (Sardinian Way) was now used for two centuries.
            It got the name <b>Voie Sarde</b> later, after the Dukes of Savoy had become sovereigns of the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1720.
            The road had become the connection between the Kingdom of Sardinia and France.
            Famous travellers have used it, like <b class="smallCaps">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</b>, and Pope <b class="smallCaps">Pius VII</b> when he came to France in 1804 to consecrate <b class="smallCaps">Napoleon I</b> as emperor.
            And <b class="smallCaps">Napoleon</b> was actually responsible, that the Sardinian Way was abandoned.
            In 1804, he found the road too arduous, and ordered a tunnel to be built.
            This tunnel is called the <b>tunnel des Échelles</b> and was started in 1806 and completed in 1820.
            Today the road D1006 crosses the ridge through this tunnel, the Sardinian Way is used as a walking trail.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The caves were known for a long time, probably even the Romans ventured into one or both, when they travelled on this road.
            However, there is no way to know, since there are no written accounts and no archaeological remains in the caves.
            They were developed in the 19th century, to provide a tourist destination for the people bathing at la Bauche les Bains.
            The iron laden thermal water was used to cure various illnesses, especially blood related diseases.
            The caves were owned at this time by the <b class="smallCaps">Périnel</b> family, who created a company for the developments of the caves in 1884 and stared to sell stocks.
            One year later the development started and in 1886 the caves were opened to the public.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The caves were then operated as show caves for more than a century.
            They were managed by various institutions, but finally in 1995 the trails were in a bad shape.
            The caves were still guided with carbide lamps, which caused a lot of work.
            As a result it was not possible to find a new lessee or an investor.
            So the caves were closed to the public, and it was not possible to enter them any more.
            In 1996 an association with the name <b>Anim'Grotte</b> was created to manage the <b>Sardinian Way</b> site, a part of the <b>Parc Naturel Régional de Chartreuse</b> (Regional Nature Park of the Chartreuse).
            They collaborated with the related institutions and obviously were funded somehow.
            So they modernized the caves with new trails and electric light and reopened them in 2002.
            Since then there is a small museum, a restaurant, modern toilets, and hourly guided tours.
            Tourist reception and ticket sales are located in the <b>Auberge des Grottes</b> (Cave Inn), an old road-mender's house dating back to when the tunnel was built.
            The <b>Anim'Grotte</b> has since been dissolved and its former web domain is now re-used by an anonymous operator who promotes show caves all over the world.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Make sure to buy your ticket at least 15 minutes before the tour starts, it's 100 m walk down the gorge to the cave entrance where the tour starts.
            The <b>Grotte Supérieure</b> (Upper Cave) is noted for various impressive speleothems in the <b>salle du Dome</b>.
            The entrance part has impressive dolly tubs and other erosional forms from the cave river.
            The Romans had problems with the water from the cave.
            The cave was normally dry during summer, but at snow melt and during heavy rains it was reactivated, at least two or three times a year, and a massive river was flowing out of the resurgence.
            Those floods threatened the road, so a channel was built by the Romans, to allow the water to flow without harming the road.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Grotte du Grand Goulet</b> (Great Gully Cave) is also called <b>Grotte Inférieure</b> (Lower Cave).
            The cave is a through-cave and is entered from the upper end, the cave crosses the mountain ridge to the other side.
            The lower entrance is a huge portal in the middle of the escarpment, with a great view to Saint Christophe La Grotte.
            Located in the middle of the cliff face, the entrance is quite high but narrow, and looks like a cleft.
            Here the path is built at the vertical wall, 20 m above the floor of the cave.
            A path along the cliff face and down a spiral staircase leads to the lower end of the Sardinian Way, where the monument is located.
            From here it's a 600 m walk uphill back to the car park.
            The water from the upper cave, flowing through the Roman channel, once entered the lower cave.
            So the dolly tubs inside were reactivated and the water reappeared at the huge entrance portal in the cliff.
            The Sardinian Way was constructed across the channel and blocks it now, so the water now flows down the road and makes tours impossible.
            It also cut off the lower cave from the water, and as a result its galleries are not reactivated any more.
            In other words, the reactivated cave would be quite interesting and spectacular, but the flood makes it inaccessible.
            Fortunately this happens only during snow melt, when the cave is actually closed, and after very heavy rains, which are rare.

            At the caves two different cave trekking tours are offered.
            On is normal caving without technical difficulties.
            The other is a sort of via ferrata inside the cave and requires a lot of climbing.
            It's called <b>Acrospeleo</b>, probably because it is for acrobats.
            The equipment is provided, but you should bring clothes to change, a towel, a plastic bag for dirty clothes and gloves.
            The cave trekking tours are organized by <b>Cordeo</b>, get more info on their website, which also allows online booking.

        <p class="indentedText">
            There is a legend, that <b class="smallCaps">Mandrin</b>, the famous Dauphiné smuggler, used one of the caves as a hideout.
            <b class="smallCaps">Louis Mandrin</b> (11-FEB-1725 to 26-MAY-1755) is a famous French smuggler.
            After his death the legend of the vigilante bandit who fought against the inequity of the taxes of the Ancien Régime was told.
            It became well known by a song named <i>Complainte de Mandrin</i> from an unknown author.
            It was actually a new text for a traditional tune, and so anyone was able to sing it.
            However, the legend was a political statement and is not accurate, he was no French <b class="smallCaps">Robin Hood</b>, just a smuggler, which is not even mentioned in the song.
