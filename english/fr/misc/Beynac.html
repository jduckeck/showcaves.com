        <!-- TODO -->

        <!--
        Near the Dordogne valley, a Bronze Age settlement was found at the foot of the
        Beynac castle. Once excavated, this site was turned into an archaeological open
        air museum, run by the Museum Association of the Sarladais area. Its chief
        purpose is educational, though it also carries out research and initiates
        projects in experimental archaeology. Various demonstrations are performed for
        the public on different days, and it is better to phone for programme details.
        Once inside the entrance, which resembles a fortified gate of a Celtic oppidum,
        the visitor can wander through the reconstructed village, pausing to observe the
        various workshops. Among the buildings on display are a Neolithic dwelling, a
        funerary dolmen that contains human remains, a Bronze Age hut with a granary,
        kilns for firing pottery and furnaces for smelting iron.

        WHERE IS IT?

        You will find the archaeological park at the foot of the Castle of Beynac, which majestically sits above the splendid Dordogne valley.

        Located on a site dating from the Bronze Age, this park is well worth a visit because it is located in an area with a rich historical legacy beginning with the origins of humanity but also because of the varied program it offers visitors. There, you will do a quite unusual experiment and you will leave the place much more knowledgeable and interested in these periods neglected by textbooks and school curricula: the Neolithic, Copper, Bronze and Iron Ages.

        Specializing in the periods from  - 6,000 to - 50 years BC, this park, which is managed by the Sarladais Museums Association, has above all a teaching mission with demonstrations but also a broad research mandate with experiments. For this purpose, the staff sometimes travels to other parts of France and abroad. On site, they manufacture stone tools and facsimiles. Much more than pleasant entertainment is offered to you and, if an interpreter tells you enthralling stories about our ancestors, they are not just fables to make you dream. Truth often far exceeds fiction and you will immerse yourself with delight in authentic discoveries of the incredible progress made by these protohistoric peoples who populated Europe at a time when the Egyptians had already built their first pyramids!!!

        WHAT DO WE SEE THERE?

        Depending on the day and the schedule, several demonstrations are presented to the public, so it's preferable to get information in advance about the day's programme.

        After having crossed the entrance door, which is reconstructed as an oppidum and contains the reception, we enter an accurately reconstructed Neolithic village in which we can meander on our own or with a guide. We are at leisure to delay in front of various workshops: flint knapping and primitive archery, pottery and cooking, weaving and dying, iron, copper and bronze casting, ore crushing and a forging mill. But also, while watching the specialists at work, we can ask questions because here, be sure of that, no stone is left unturned to tell us what it's all about!

        NEOLITHIC ERA (- 6000 to - 3200)

        After millennia of wandering, this is a crucial period for humanity because tribes settled, built first villages and devoted themselves to cereal cultivation and the breeding/domestication of animals such as sheep, pigs, goats and cattle. They also discovered new technologies: weaving, pottery, and polished stone. Other changes also occurred in the culture of these new farmers who thought of new concepts such as property and territory. Thus, new funerary rites appeared with the dolmen (burials) and menhirs were erected. But also, with the clearing of the forests, a new landscape that resembled ours more closely took form. In the Park, we are able to visit a typical Neolithic house with its various installations and a dolmen under a tumulus (with real human bones inside!).

        Flint knapping workshop

        If you think that it is easy to work flint, you are mistaken! This implies intelligence, skill and transmission of knowledge, proof that our ancestors perpetuated the knowledge of this skill over generations who continuously improved techniques.
        Flint contains silica and, therefore, it cuts like glass. We begin with a core, i.e., a large block of flint. This core is obtained by removing it from the surrounding limestone. For this, the craftsman needs tools such as rollers and round soft and hard hammers made from stag antlers. Then, he has to determine the impact points at which to hit correctly and very precisely to get the desired tools from the block. By striking directly or indirectly, shock waves are sent along the edges of the stone. If you have played billiards, you will easily understand the principle: It is necessary for the craftsman to anticipate his idea before working the object. He has to visualize and plan because he cannot waste the raw material, especially when he had to walk days to get it in some far away place and bring it back to the camp!
        During the Neolithic era, the craftsman polished the edges (if not he would break the flint) because people needed axes to cut trees and clear forests. Then, he added a handle and let it soak in water. The wood expanded and held the stone fast. Clever, isn't?

        COPPER AGE (- 3200 to - 2300)

        It is a hinge period characterized by the invention of metallurgy, the appearance of first copper tools and the goldsmith's trade. Of course, there are first copper jewels but weapons (daggers, arrowheads, axes) are especially prominent because humans had become warriors who wanted to protect their territory and conquer others. Moreover, with technical progress, a demographic expansion was under way. Were these the first true problems for humanity?

        BRONZE AGE (- 2300 to - 750)

        By adding tin to copper, you make bronze, an alloy that is harder and more effective for manufacturing tools and weapons. However, the Bronze Age is also a very important period in economic and cultural exchanges by sea and land between European and Mediterranean peoples (Greeks, Etruscans). These people discovered animal haulage, which facilitates agriculture, burned their dead, made innovations in funerary deposits and placed burials in caves. To summarize, we never stop to progress!
        In the park, you can visit a Bronze Age house, the grain storage and the potter's ovens.

        In a wood house with a pointed roof, you will be able to attend to a spectacular experiment that you will not forget: casting bronze as it was practised in ancient times. In the centre of the circular building, there is a clay furnace, i.e., an open fireplace with a conduit (ventilation shaft that blows air into the fire). At its end, there is a bellows made of animal skin. The craftsman starts by lighting a fire with pyrite or flint and tinder (made from a tree fungus). Violent striking of the flint against iron provides the sparks to ignite this dry and light material. Then, it is enough to transfer the incandescent flame to a more solid fuel. Unquestionably, that seems like magic!
        Then, the maker fills the furnace with charcoal and does not stop blowing to stoke the fire and raise the temperature. He places the ore in a clay crucible and covers it with charcoal. After approximately one hour, the air in the thatched cottage has become hot! The craftsman who did not stop working his bellows is not cold either!!! Undoubtedly, formerly several individuals took turns.

        Moulds are put into the fire according to a quite precise procedure. Stone moulds, bivalves and the lost wax method are used depending on the type of object that the craftsman wishes to make. Bronze moulds are also manufactured half with river silt and half with horse dung.  When temperatures reach 1200°C, the craftsman seizes the crucible with long tongues and pours the contents all at once into the mould. Leather gloves made of turned-over sheepskin are used to protect the hands and feet during handling. Often, they are reinforced with harder leather. The release from the mould can be almost instantaneous by immersion in cold water but the best technique is letting it rest in the fire's ashes until the following day. Axes and daggers are made here. When the demonstration is over, the objects are finally in our hands. In the twilight of the hut, the red fireplace still smells of metal, wood and ashes, leaving us amazed at how this magic experiment proceeded, step-by-step, in front of our attentive eyes - a breathtaking experiment.

        The maker is not only works with his hands but also with his ears and eyes. He listens attentively to furnace noises that tell him much useful information while performing the operation. He also looks at the fire because the changing colours are invaluable indications of the temperature. His experiment guarantees success. He is both a project superintendent and an artist with a full share in his work. Some Japanese master artisans compare the furnace to a womb, which makes the craftsman an obstetrician of sorts. They think a man can have fun with several women but when it is a question of giving life to his own child, it is best to draw the rivals far away from the fireplace and let his wife quietly bear the child. Is this the reason why women were excluded from workshops?

        Some precise details:
        For the Greeks, the alchemical symbol for copper was Venus and Zeus for tin
        Bronze is made of 89-92% copper and 8-11% tin
        5 to 8 kg of cast metal per day represent 25 to 35 objects per day


        IRON AGE (- 750 to- 52)

        With the appearance of this more easily worked metal, the Celts asserted themselves, occupying almost all of modern France and Belgium. They consisted of several tribes without any true political unity.  The first currencies, horticulture and arboriculture appeared. A true trade network with the Romans was established little by little.

        In the Park, we can see the forging mill and the low furnace, the weaving workshop, the fortified Gallic door and a glass workshop.
