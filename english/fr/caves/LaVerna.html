        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            We heard of the youngest show cave in France which is named <b>La Salle de La
            Verna</b> and located in the Pyrénées at the border to Spain.
            It has a huge chamber, and a new website.
            After some reading the whole story got strange, until we discovered that this is
            neither a show cave, nor is it new at all.
            The actual name of this cave is <b>Gouffre de la Pierre Saint Martin</b>, it was
            discovered and explored in the 1950s, became the deepest cave of the world and
            was the place of a tragic cave accident.
            And it was well published, as <b class="smallCaps">Norbert Casteret</b> was part
            of the team, and he wrote a book which was published in numerous languages.
            So let us see if we tell the story in the correct order.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave was discovered in 1950 by <b class="smallCaps">Georges
            Lépineux</b> on the last day of this years expedition, so they had to
            leave it for next year.
            It was located in the middle of the <b>Pierre Saint Martin karst plateau</b>,
            an area 140km&sup2; large and between 1,500m asl and 2,100m asl high.
            They dropped a perpendicular, but the first time the 200m rope were not enough,
            so they retried and measured 370m.
            This was the deepest daylight shaft known at this time, and it was named <b
                class="smallCaps">Gouffre Lépineux</b> in honour of its discoverer.
            The cave had made its first world record without a single caver entering it.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In 1951 the cave was entered for the first time.
            The cavers had constructed a winch with almost 400m of 5mm thick steel rope.
            It was powered by a modified bicycle with one manpower, which had two sets of
            pedals, one for the feet and one for the hands.
            Numerous cavers went down and got an overview of the first chamber, and a second
            shaft leading down to a cave river.
            At the end of the expedition, the winch was starting to fail and they planned a
            better winch for the next year.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            One of the cavers constructed a new winch for 1952, which weighed 100kg and was
            rather sturdy.
            Nevertheless, it failed several times, a general problem with selfmade
            constructions.
            But at last they entered the cave again and explored new passages.
            When they returned, one of the cavers, <b class="smallCaps">Marcel Loubins</b>
            was lifted up, when the end-loop of the cable broke, and he fell back 30m to the
            ground.
            He broke many bones and after three days he died in the cave, although one of
            the covers was a doctor and tried to help him as much as he could.
            It was hard work to get all team members back to the surface, but it was not
            possible to take the body with them, so they made a temporary grave inside the
            cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave, named <b class="smallCaps">Gouffre Lépineux</b> became famous,
            or probably infamous.
            Newspapers and radio stations reported every dramatic detail.
            But everbody named the cave <b>Pierre Saint Martin</b>, and that name stuck.
            Later a chamber inside the cave was named <b class="smallCaps">Salle
            Lépineux</b>, to <i>compensate</i> him for the loss.
            So today the cave system is named <b>Pierre Saint Martin</b>, while the original
            entrance is actually named <b class="smallCaps">Gouffre Lépineux</b> on
            many maps.
            It's really complicated, but at least did the cavers of those times choose
            dramatic names.
            Todays cavers tend to choose infantile names like <b>Castle of Edam</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In 1953 the cave exploration went on and was very successful.
            The cave was surveyed and as a result it became the deepest cave at this time.
            And they discovered the <b>Salle de la Verna</b>, 255m long, 245m wide, and 194m
            high, which was the largest cave chamber known at this time.
            They also surveyed the depth of the cave with 734m, which made it the deepest cave
            of the world.
            But they again had technical difficulties and were not able to lift the body of
            <b class="smallCaps">Marcel Loubins</b> out of the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Unfortunately the cave entrance is located right on the Spanish/French border,
            so there were frequent disputes with the Spanish border patrol.
            At this time the Franco regime ruled in Spain and the borders were rather
            sensible.
            So in 1954 the Spanish soldiers stopped the exploration but finally allowed to
            get the body of <b class="smallCaps">Marcel Loubins</b> out of the cave.
            They probably imagined that "Spain denies heroic explorer his final rest" would
            be a poor international headline.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The exploration results were used economically soon after the exploration.
            The <b>&Eacute;lectricité de France</b> (EDF, French electric power
            company) used the survey data to plan an underground hydroelectric power plant.
            In 1956 they drilled a 600m long tunnel into the cave, to redirect the cave
            river.
            But planning errors and technical difficulties made it a fail.
            There was not enough water in the river so the plan did not work out, but the
            biggest problem was that the tunnel ended high above the cave river.
            However, among cavers and scientists all over the world the failure was unknown,
            and so it was generally know as the only energy plant in a cave.
            It is for example mentioned in <b class="smallCaps">Trimmel</b>s
            <b>Höhlenkunde</b>, which was published two years later.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tunnel provided a much easier access to the cave system, far from the
            Spanish border.
            During the next decades exploration continued, but visits have always been
            strictly limited with the need to obtain permissions.
            In 1966 the <b>Association pour la recherche spéléologique
            internationale de la Pierre Saint-Martin</b> (arsip) was founded to coordinate
            the numerous national and international cavers which came to explore the caves
            of the area.
            Today the cave system is more than 80km long and 1,400m deep.
            But its world records are all gone, as bigger caves have been discovered since
            then.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The hydroelectric power project was revived by the new owner, the
            <b>Société Hydro &Eacute;lectrique du Midi</b> (SHEM), in 2006.
            They renovated the tunnel and built steel tubes from the end of the tunnel to
            the Salle de La Verna, where they now catch the water.
            The power plant was inaugurated in 2008 and produces 4 Megawatt.
            As a side effect there is now a trail to this chamber, originally intended for
            the engineers and workers, which is obviously also suitable for cave visitors.
            At first the SHEM allowed only its own personell in what they see as a part of
            their power plant.
            But the <b>Comité Départemental de Spéléologie des
            Pyrénées-Atlantiques</b> organized tourist visits which started in
            2010.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A last word for the show-cave-status of this cave, as the organizers of the tours actually insist that it is a show cave.
            Nevertheless we decided to call it a semi-wild cave.
            The main problem is, that there is no obejctive definition of a show cave.
            Until today the definition of Hubert Trimmel is the best we have: a cave is a
            show cave if most of the following criteria are fulfilled:
            light, paths, closed by a gate, regular open hours, entrance fee, and guided tours.
            Obviously a show cave is still a show cave, if there is no light, or if there are self guided tours.
            The easy paths are probably the most important critera.
            So in general, its hard to find a sharp edge between a show cave and a wild cave.
            In this case we decided to still classify La Verna as a semi-wild cave because of three critera: there is no light system, which is rather problematic because of the huge size of the chamber.
            No personal light source, no matter how bright, will be able to light this cve appropritely.
            There are no trails, as the tours use the path constructed by the electrical power company, the cave itself is actually undeveloped.
            And finally there are no regular open hours, the cave might be visited only after appointment.
            This becomes more frequent for show caves, as a result of the restriction of visitor numbers for cave protection.
            But this cave is huge and there is no reason to restrict the visitor numbers because of the low impact.
            So actually the three most iportant criteria: light, trails, and accessibility, are not fulfilled.
        </p>
