            It was developed but never open to the pub.
            When they finally opened it after years, it was open only for a month and then it was closed again for the protection of a bat roost in the cave.
14 species of protected bats
            European funding for development
            Named pearl because of the pearl like drops of water on the stalactites.

        "Biserna" ("Zandana") is the longest (2,200 m.) And most beautiful cave on the Shumen plateau. It is located in the area "Kyoshkove", 1 km west of Shumen and 404 m above sea level. The cave is sloping, ascending, branching, two-storey and water, with water constantly flowing from it. Its entrance is about 50 m lower than the ridge of the plateau and faces northeast. During the improvement of the cave (in 1986) a new entrance was made, located 5 m higher. It facilitates the access of visitors. Currently, the artificial entrance of the cave is concreted, which aims to preserve the purity of the cave river, microclimate, fauna and cave formations.

        The cave is developed in two floors (Upper and Lower Gallery) and the difference in their levels is 6 m. The lower floor is an underground river, and above the underground stream there is an old dry riverbed. The galleries are located one above the other and have a permanent vertical connection.

        The configuration of "Biserna" follows a southwest-northeast direction of development. The sequence of galleries is as follows: the Eastern Gallery, the Main Gallery, the Water Gallery, the Great Hall, the Sinter Hall and the Mud Gallery. Along the arch of the cave there are many differently colored stalactites, which in places merge into beautiful and varied curtains. The floor is littered with stalagmites. There are many stalactons of different shapes and sizes and some bizarre shapes such as "Castle", "Beehive", "Cacti", "Throne" and others.

        The great nightingale is the most common representative of the bats inhabiting the cave.

        Biserna Cave (Zandana) is the longest and most beautiful cave on the Shumen plateau. The first reports of it were in 1928 by the French geographer Jean-Denis Barbier du Bocage. Serious research began in 1968 by Shumen and Sofia speleologists. As a result of several expeditions, 2,200 m of the cave were explored and mapped. In 2003 the cave club at the Madara Horseman Tourist Association in Shumen continued the research and opened new galleries, whereby the length of the cave "increased" to 2,716 m.Biserna Cave is located in the Kyoshkove locality, 1 km west of the town of Shumen and 404 m above sea level. It is sloping, ascending, branching, two-storey and water, with water constantly flowing from it. Its entrance is about 50 m lower than the ridge of the plateau and faces northeast. It is developed in two floors (Upper and Lower Gallery). The lower floor is an underground river with an average flow of 8 l / s. The galleries are located one above the other and have a permanent vertical connection. The configuration of Biserna Cave follows the southwest-northeast direction of development.

        The sequence of galleries is as follows: East Gallery, Small Gallery, Main Gallery, Water Gallery, Large Hall, Beautiful Hall, Siphon and Dry Gallery. The cave is rich in formations of different sizes and colors: stalactites, stalagmites, stalactites, draperies, sinter barks, tiger decoration and more. Some of the bizarre shapes are called "Castle", "Beehive", "Cacti", "Throne", "Steamer", etc.   The cave is inhabited by 14 species of bats, which form numerous colonies inside. Currently, the natural (old) entrance of the cave is closed, which aims to preserve the purity of the cave river, microclimate, fauna and cave formations.

        The tourist route is about 800 meters long in one direction, the entrance is one and the return is the same way. Biserna Cave can be reached on foot, as the forest road is not suitable for cars. The vehicles can be parked on the asphalt road before the turn for the villa of the Municipality of Shoumen. There are two walking routes - from the park "Kyoshkove" - ​​"Lesson on the forest path" and from the junction for the Fortress "Old Town" on the way to the villa of Shumen municipality . Signs are placed on all routes.

The temperature in Biserna Cave is currently 10 degrees, so it is necessary for visitors to have warm clothes. Due to the high humidity and cave water, it is recommended that tourists wear appropriate closed shoes.



"Biserna" or "Zandana", as it has been known for centuries by Shumen residents, is located almost within the city limits, literally a kilometer and a half away - two of the last houses in Shumen.
