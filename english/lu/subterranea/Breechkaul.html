        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The <b>Amphitheater "Breechkaul"</b> is an open air theatre which is used for
            concerts and other festivities.
            It is located jn a forest where quarry works created numerous strange rock
            formations.
            One of those formations, a small cave or grotto which was excavated about 1,000
            years ago, was used to build the amphitheatre.
            The cave is used as stage and backstage.
            The walls create an excellent accoustics while the forest makes this place realy
            unique.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The rock here is suitable to produce millstones.
            It is most likely that the first millstones were broken here 2000 years ago by
            the Romans.
            However, written documents are not know, neither archaeological evidence was
            found.
            But most quarries along the Mosella have Roman roots.
            This is sometimes hard to prove, as the technique used to cut the rock was the
            same until the Middle Ages.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            As this area belonged to the <b>Abby Oeren</b> near Trier, the church ruled that
            all mills belonging to the abby had to buy their millstones from this quarry.
            This are the first documents mentioning the quarries.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The name <b>Breechkaul</b> has German origin, <i>brechen</i> means to break, and
            <i>kaul</i> or <i>Kuhle</i> is a pit or quarry.
            But it has nothing to do with the quarrying, it is a term coming from the
            production of linen.
            The flax plants have fibers in its stems which were harvested by drying and
            roasting the plant, so the skin of the stem became brittle and by breaking it
            the fiber was released.
            This breaking of the roasted plant was obviously done here in this cool and
            shady place, definitely a good loacation for the hard work.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The place was "discovered" by a local teacher, <b class="smallCaps">Edmond
            Steyer</b>, when he visited the place with his class.
            It was a typical school outing for many years to walk to this place, but other
            teachers just wated outside while the pupils explored the various caves.
            But he began to think about the original shape of this quarry, which was covered
            by up to 6 m of debris.
            And then he had the idea to creat an amphitheater in the bowl.
            He soon found another fighter for this idea, <b class="smallCaps">Jean
            Friedrich</b> from the tourist ministery.
            After he had organized the permissions and some money, the place was cleaned and
            transformed into it current shape in only six weeks.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The place was inaugurated with a <b>Hubertusmesse</b> (St Hubert mass) which is
            held since then every year and is still popular.
            This is a mass which is held to remember St <b class="smallCaps">Hubert</b>.
            He was a young aristocrat who was very fond of hunting, but after his wife had
            died he left his home and went into the forest and gave himself up entirely to
            hunting.
            When he did hunt on Good Friday morning the white stag turned around and had a
            crucifix between his antlers.
            A voice sayd "Hubert, unless thou turnest to the Lord, and leadest an holy life,
            thou shalt quickly go down into hell".
            So he became a man of the church and later the Bishop of Li&egrave;ge.
            He is the patron Saint of the hunters.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The xtage of the theatre is a fine example of a millstone quarry.
            There are even some incomplete millstones at the wall, which were never
            finished.
            But in the surroundings ther are numerous other similar rock formations, with
            articial cliff faces and caves.
            The place is also called <b>Hohllay</b>, where <i>hohl</i> means hollow and
            <i>lay</i> is a medieval term for rock.
        </p>
