        <p>
            <b>Dunmore Cave</b> is described in folklore as <i>the mouth of a huge beast, with ten thousand teeth above his head and as many under his feet</i>.
            The huge, imposing entrance has been known for centuries, but it is only comparatively recent that it has been fully explored.
            Until the seventeenth century caves were regarded with dread and awe as being entrances to Hell.
            From the eighteenth century onwards a number of visitors, including scientists and historians, have written about the cave.
            Research on geological and historical aspects of the cave has been pursued making it one of the best documented cave sites in Europe.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Dunmore cave is, since 1940, in the care of the Commissioners of Public Works as a National Monument because of its historic interest.
            In 1967 a Development Committee for the cave was formed, mainly through the enthusiasm of <b class="smallCaps">J. C. Coleman</b>.
            A visitor centre and site museum were built and the cave surroundings were landscaped.
            Stairs and walkways and an extensive lighting system were installed inside.

        <p>
            Remains found at Dunmore include coins and human bones.
            An old chronicle tells about a tragedy around AD 928, when more than 1000 people were seeking refuge underground from marauding vikings.
            In the Irish Annals the cave was called <b>Dearc Fearna</b> (Cave of the Alders).
            In 1973 the bones of 44 people, mostly women, children and elderly folk, were found in the cave.
            In 1996, more human bones were discovered in another part of the cave.
            It was a female and a newborn child or foetus.
            It is not clear if they are related to the 44 others, only a small part of the bones were found and it was impossible to reconstruct the story.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Soon after, in 2000, a tour guide who cleaned the cave around the tour path, found a viking treasure of coins and woven silver buttons.
            The hoard was concealed in a rocky cleft.
            It consisted of 43 silver and bronze items which were dated by several coins minted in the North of England to around 970 AD.
            Someone obviously hid his valueables here in the cave, but was not able to retrieve them later, most likely because he was dead.
            This treasure was so astonishing, it was even mentioned in a documentary called <b>The Ultimate Ten Amazing Treasures</b> of <b>The Learning Channel</b> in the U.S.A.
            Immediately the cave was closed for archaeological work.
            This time was used for general reconstruction of the show cave.
            The Visitor Centre was expanded, and after the dig and the renovation, the cave was reopened.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Dunmore Cave</b> is located on the Castlecomer plateau, overlooking the <b>Dinin River Valley</b>.
            In this area a small and isolated limestone outcrop exists.
            Therefore, Dunmore Cave is the only cave of significance known in southeast Ireland.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The entrance is 12 m wide and 6 m high, lying at the bottom of a 20 m deep pit, a so-called
            <a target="_top" href="../../explain/Karst/Doline.html"><img alt="Karst" class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Karst.png">Doline</a>
            where the roof of the cave collapsed many years ago.
            Most of the cave is horizontal and has two different levels.
            Many chambers in the cave are the product of roof collapse along lines of weakness in the rock.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The largest dripstone pillar of the cave, the so-called <b>Market Cross</b>, is over 5 m high and 1.3 m across.
            There is little to suggest that here, according to legend, <b>Luchtigen</b> - the monster <i>Lord of the Mice</i> - was slaughtered.
            The calcite deposits in this chamber, called the Town Hall, are very pure as indicated by their whiteness.
        </p>

        <p>
            The area near the entrance shows an interesting zonation of vegetation due to the great changes in environment.
            On the way down the staircase, the common flowering plants of the area are gradually replaced by ferns, then by liverworts and then by green algae on the rocks.
            Within the entrance itself, only a few algae and fungi are present.
            The interior of the cave is virtually devoid of plant life.
            Since man visits the cave, a white fungus has sprung up in several places, obtaining its nourishment from spots of candle grease.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At one time, the cave supported a large bat colony, but nowadays bats are only to be found in the remoter recesses of the cave.
            In some parts of the cave, bat skeletons encrusted with calcite flowstone have been found.
        </p>
