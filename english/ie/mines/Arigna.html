        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Arigna Coal Mine</b> is (in-)famous for having the narrowest coal seams in
            the western world.
            Seams of 45cm were mined, by miners lying on their side to shovel the coal out.
            Obviously not the best position for competition in a shrinking world.
            However, the coal mining lasted until 1990, the coal was used for iron works and
            later for a power plant.
            With the demolition of the ESB Generating Station chimney, the era of the coal
            ended.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The mining history at Arigna started in the Middle Ages with the mining of
            <b>iron</b>.
            East of Lough Allen lies a mountain called <b>Slieve Anierin</b>, which
            translates to <b>Iron Mountain</b>.
            At the beginning of the 17th century, the iron was smelted at Arigna in new
            built iron works, using <b>charcoal</b>, which was burnt from the wood of the
            forests around.
            But as no organised tree planting took place and the timber eventually ran out,
            the iron works had to be closed at the end of the 17th century.
            More than half a century later, in 1765, the mining of the coal deposits
            started, and again 30 years later the smelting was revived using the local coal
            instead of charcoal.
            This iron works closed finally in 1838, as they were not very successfull.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But coal mining continued and provided work for the people in the area.
            The coal was used to heat homes and hospitals, and to power steam engines.
            In 1958 the Arigna Power Station was opened to produce electricity.
            It was the first major power generating station in Connacht.
            The station was built specifically to burn the semi bituminous coal with its
            high ash content.
            At its height, the power station burned 55,000 tons of coal per year and
            employed 60 people.
            Like in other coal mining areas of Europe, the main goal of this power station
            was to secure the jobs in the local mining industry.
            During the internationalization process during the mid 20th century, foreign
            coal from much bigger and easier to mine deposits became much cheaper than loacl
            coal.
            At the end of the 1980s the power station was shut down, and without its main
            buyer the mine closed in 1990.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Because of the thin coal seams, a special type of mining was practised at
            Arigna.
            A main tunnel was driven from which branched a series of secondary tunnels every
            5-6 meters, were the coal was mined.
            The secondary tunnels followed the seams and were rather low.
            The miners typically worked lying on their back to cut the coal.
            This <b>Cutters</b> or <b>Brushers</b> also prepared the mine for the next days
            work, extended the roads and used explosives.
            <b>Drawers</b> filled hutches and pushed them out to the main underground mine
            road.
            Here the hutches were linked up to the haulage system, an endless rope, and
            pulled to the outside.
            Sometimes small diesel locomotives were used to pull hutches out of the pit.
            <b>Proppers</b> used timber pillars to prop up the mine roof.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Arigna Mining Experience consists of an exhibition and an optional
            underground tour.
            The underground tour is guided by former miners, who are able to answer any kind
            of questions on the coal mining process.
            This tour is a little difficult, as the mine is often very low.
            Visitord get hard hats to protect their heads.
            Lighting and sound effects throughout the mine are intended to add to the
            reality of the experience.
