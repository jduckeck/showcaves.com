        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The <b>Schwandorfer Felsenkeller</b> (Schwandorf rock cellars) are located in a sandstone layer of the Middle Jurassic or Dogger, locally called "Brown" Jurassic, which can be found on the slope of the Holzberg along the Naab.
            There are a total of 130 cellars over a length of one kilometre, which have been used for a wide variety of purposes over the course of history.
            During the Second World War, some were used as air raid shelters.
            These cellars are today boldly advertised as "Bavaria's largest labyrinth of rock cellars".
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Most of the cellars were dug around 1500 as beer cellars, as brewing flourished in Schwandorf at this time.
            At this time, the breweries switched from top-fermented to bottom-fermented or "cold" fermentation.
            This beer was more drinkable, but above all could be stored for longer, which is why it is also known as lager in many countries.
            However, after the actual brewing process, longer storage below 10 °C was necessary, and the 8 °C cool cellars were able to provide this.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Schwandorf had the so-called communal brewers, whose breweries were located along the Naab river.
            They prepared the brew and then placed it in the rock cellars for fermentation and storage.
            After storage, the beer was served in a set order.
            For this purpose, a temporary taproom was set up in the living room of the respective brewer, which was indicated by a Zeigl (Zoigl, Zeugl) or Buschen, which was attached to the outside of the house.
            When all the beer was sold, it was the next communal brewer’s turn.
            The communal brewing trade in Schwandorf developed into a considerable economic factor.
            In the middle of the 16th century, the brewers even began to export beer to Regensburg and Nabburg.
            Alongside agriculture and fishing, brewing was the town’s most important source of income.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In 1807, however, there was a reorganisation and the municipal breweries throughout Bavaria were sold because their maintenance costs were a heavy burden on the municipal coffers.
            In Schwandorf, the municipal breweries and malt houses were sold by order of the royal district court of Burglengenfeld in 1812.
            They became a brewing company founded by 83 guarantors and from then on the right to brew was linked to the purchase of a share certificate in this brewing company.
            In the middle of the 19th century, there was an upswing in the brewing industry and cellar construction, partly as a result of the connection to the railway network.
            Several local brewers asked for permission to set up private breweries, and once this was granted, they expanded their rock cellars into extensive systems and drastically increased beer production.
            Increasing competition led to a decline in the number of communal brewers in the early 20th century.
            With the outbreak of the First World War, the communal brewing industry came to an almost complete standstill, as many men were at the front, the fields remained uncultivated, and there was a shortage of barley and hops.
            After the war, the last communal brewers gave up, but the private breweries built modern fermentation plants and cold stores, and the rock cellars became less important.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Cellars no longer used for storing beer were used to store potatoes, turnips and other agricultural produce.
            But they were also used for everyday foodstuffs, spirits, coffee and meat and sausage products from the local butcher’s trade.
            Cellar thieves took advantage of public holidays when people did not get into their cellars and broke through the dividing walls between cellars to clear them out.
            As a side effect of the theft, they were also the creators of a labyrinth of 60 cellar rooms that are now connected.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Large areas of the cellars were converted into air raid shelters as early as 1943 and 1944.
            For this purpose, belt arches to improve the statics, walling and escape tunnels were created.
            The latter was particularly important because if an entrance was blocked by a collapse, it had to be possible to leave the air-raid shelter by another route.
            This was exactly the opposite of the original requirement that cellar rooms only had one lockable entrance if possible.
            The air raid shelters were also equipped with telephone and light lines.
            Consideration was even given to relocating industries underground.
            The command centre of the then provisional mayor was set up in the cellar of the Hubmann brewery.
            The worst-case scenario was the night of the bombing on 17 April 1945, when a British-Canadian squadron reduced most of the town to rubble within a few minutes at 3:52 in the morning.
            6,000 people sought refuge in the rock cellars, with 4,000 refugees in the Hubmann cellar alone.
            They had to hold out here for many days in unbearable hygienic conditions.
            The cellars in Waldgasse were used as military hospitals and were overcrowded with the wounded.
            But despite the cellars, there were some 4,000 dead, including 1,250 Schwandorf residents.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The traumatic experiences were certainly one reason why people no longer wanted to know about the cellars after the war.
            They were no longer used, fell into disrepair and collapsed and crumbled.
            The rooms filled up with rubbish.
            Only in recent years have some cellars been renovated and opened to the public.
            Guided tours now take place all year round, as well as so-called adventure tours and children’s tours on special dates.
            Unfortunately, the opening times are very complicated, which is why we have to refer you to the official website.
            It is also essential to book an appointment, either online or by telephone, so a spontaneous visit is not possible.
