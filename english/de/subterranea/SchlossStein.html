        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The cave castle <b>Schloß Stein</b> (literally Castle Rock) is the biggest cave castle in Germany.
            It is located in the town Stein, both the town and the castle are named after the huge cliff.
            The whole fortification has three distinct parts:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>The <b>Hochschloß</b> (high castle) is located at the rim on top of 50 m high vertical conglomerate cliff. At this place a prehstoric settlement has been excavated.</li>
            <li>The <b>Höhlenburg</b> (cave castle) is built into the cliff face like a swallow nest.</li>
            <li>The <b>Neues Schloß</b> (new castle) is located at the foot of the cliff and is still in use. It houses a private high school.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            The cave of the cave castle is actually a rather shallow grotto formed by the overhanging cliff.
            The cave wall was integrated into the castle forming the rear walls.
            The original cavern has been intensively modified by man.
            It was enlarged and walls were sculptured, either to gain more room or to make the walls smooth or vertical.
            And a tunnel was built from the cave castle to the high castle, but its use is lost in time.
            It was most likely not a secret passage to flee to the other castle when one was under siege.
            It seems it was just for convenience, to connect both castles in the shortest possible way, as it was almost impossible to build a connection in front of the cliff.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The rock is locally called <b>Nagelfluh</b>, which is another word for conglomerate.
            A conglomerate is a sedimentary rock formed from small pebbles which are glued together by other material.
            It is formed in front of the Alps when the debris from the erosion of the mountain ridge is sedimented and ground water brings dissolved minerals, which crystallize in the fissures.
            Conglomerate is normally not karstified, only if all components - pebbles and the glue inbetween - are made of limestone.
            The cavern here was formed by the erosion of the river Traun, so it is an erosional cave or a river cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            To the west of the cave castle is a <b>Einsiedlerklause</b> (hermits recluse) also built into the cliff face.
            It was first mentioned in a document in 1690 and was inhabited by a hermit until 1934.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The guided tour starts at the new castle at the foot of the cliff, behind the restaurant Brauereigasthof Martini.
            This castle is not open to the public, it is used as a private boarding chool.
            The tour enters the tower of the castle and goes up to the cave casle.
            Here several layers of the castle are visited.
            Finally, the underground tunnel to the high castle is used.
            It ends in the patio of the castle, the castle itself is not open to the public.
            Here the tour ends, and you can walk back a steep trail along the cliff down to the town.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            For a long time, the guided tours were conducted by the <b>Verein Freunde der Burg Stein e.V.</b> (Friends of Stein Castle Association).
            For some years now, they have been organised by the <b>Schlossbrauerei Stein</b> (Stein Castle Brewery).
            There is a brewery tour of Stein Castle Brewery with beer tasting and a guided tour of the cave castle.
            It is also possible to do a combination of both.
            The tour of the cave castle is called the Historic Cave Castle Tour.
            Once a year at the beginning of October there are also guided tours of the <b>Einsiedlerklause</b> (Hermit's recluse), but only by appointment.
        </p>


        <h2 class="center">The gruesome story of <i>Heinz von Stein dem Wilden</i></h2>

        <p>
            This legend was written down in 1783 for the first time by <b class="smallCaps">Lorenz Hübner</b> as a play which was subtitled <i>vaterländisches Trauerspiel</i> (patriotic tragedy).
            It is about the first owner of the castle, <b>Heinz von Stein</b>, who led such a wicked life that he was not allowed to rest in consecrated ground.
        </p>

        <div class="foreign">
            <p>
                Once upon a time, wild <b class="smallCaps">Heinz</b>, who was said to be of herculean size and fearsome looking, succeeded to take captive lovely <b class="smallCaps">Waltraud</b> on one of his raids.
                She was the daughter of the old <b class="smallCaps">Gravenecker</b>, the Meier (mayor) of the town Trostberg.
                With threats and flattery Heinz tried to make the beautiful woman docile - but she remained steadfast.
                In her resistance she was strengthened by her lover, <b class="smallCaps">Siegfried von Gebsattel</b>, who has meanwhile disguised himself as a groom under Heinzen's wild bunch.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Gravenecker tries in vain to free his daughter and gets caught in the attack on the castle.
                Heinz now demands the innocence of Waltraud for her father's life, and as the old Meier refuses such a trade, the brute tugs him to the execution place.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Waltraud, however, commits suicide, as Heinz tries to approach her.
                In the meantime Siegfried has succeeded in letting soldiers from Munich and Salzburg into the castle unnoticed.
                They conquer the castle and put down Heinzens people.
                He himself is stabbed to death by the fierce Siegfried, who finds him next to the dead Waltraud and considers him the murderer.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                When Gravenecker, freed from the executioner's hand at the last moment, sees the body of his daughter, he collapses dead in grief.
                The pained Siegfried finally learns with a shiver, that he has killed his own father in Heinz.
                Heinz had ordered him to be exposed soon after his birth.
            </p>
