            <br clear="all">

            <p>
                <b>Bärenhöhle</b> is situated near the village of
                Erpfingen, about 10 miles south of Reutlingen.
                For a time the cave was known as "Karlshöhle",
                until the discovery of a new series in 1949, named
                Bärenhöhle. For some years afterwards the cave was
                known as Bären-Karlshöhle, but today it is called by
                one name, Bärenhöhle (Bears Cave), the Home of the
                Cave Bear.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                "Karlshöhle" (formerly known as "Erpfinger Höhle")
                was discovered quite by chance on 30th May, 1834, by
                a local schoolteacher, called Fauth. Fauth was gathering
                herbs and digging for Valerian root when he was startled
                to see some stones roll into a gap between two large
                boulders. To his surprise he heard them land in the
                depths and to verify this he threw several more stones
                down. As he bent forward his tobacco box fell from his
                pocket into a small crevice at the edge of the drop.
                Gently, he removed a small stone but in doing so he
                dislodged the box so that it fell into the cave. Peering
                into the depths his surprise was even greater when he
                saw a human skeleton!
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The following day he returned to the hole with
                several friends and the necessary ropes. He was soon
                lowered into the cave and his friends quickly joined him.
                In the glimmering light of their candles the more they
                saw, the greater was their amazement. The floor of the
                chamber was covered with human and animal skeletons,
                while their passage was further hindered by multitudes
                of stalagmite formations. Remembering the cause of
                their errand they searched very carefully for Fauth's
                tobacco box but could not find it anywhere. When they
                left the cave they each took with them bones and stalagmites as proof of
                their discovery.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                After the first exploration the news of their discovery
                spread. People from the surrounding villages came to
                visit the cave and nearly all the bones and formations
                were either destroyed or carried away. A report was made
                to the Royal Administration and the cave was placed
                under their supervision.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                In order to provide better access to the cave a hole
                was dug at the western end. This proved quite practical
                as the cave at this point consisted of clay and boulders
                of Jurassic Limestone, indicating that there had been an
                entrance here at earlier times, although it was probably
                blocked with glacial debris after the last ice age.
                The short excavated passage still leads to the First
                Chamber. This is about 20ft. high and 50ft. wide. In one
                corner daylight shines in through a hole in the roof called "Fauthsloch"
                after the discoverer of the cave as it was
                through this opening that Fauth and his friends first descended in order
                to explore the cave. Beneath "Fauthsloch" there used to be a large mound of debris about 15ft.
                high containing 50 skeletons of the Plague, together with
                the bones of horse, cow, pig, sheep, dog, polecat and
                hare. These remains dated from 700 AD back to the
                Hallstatt period of the Iron Age. Evidence in the form of
                flints has also been found in this chamber proving that
                early man used this cave at the time of the Reindeer
                Hunters.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The Second Chamber continues on from the first without
                any change in passage cross-section. The two
                chambers are very similar although the second is not
                quite as long and only contains a few rather grubby
                formations.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                On the right is the site of an ancient fireplace just in
                front of a beautiful cascade. Here a large amount of
                wood-charcoal was found together with the bones of
                deer and pig, further evidence that early man lived in
                this cave.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The Third Chamber presents a complete contrast from
                the two proceeding chambers. The first thing which one
                notices are the large boulders through which the pathway
                winds. Many of these boulders are over 12ft. long and
                weigh many tons. On one boulder a stalagmite is growing.
                It is already 3ft. high showing that the boulder fell from
                the roof a long time ago. The footpath dips down into
                a hollow and the visitor arrives in The Forth Chamber. The
                formations are rather dry and dead and one is inclined
                to hurry on to The Fifth Chamber where the highlight is
                the large stalagmite called "The Peak" which has a
                slender stalactite above it. The surrounding walls are
                covered with calcite drapery.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                At this point it would not be out of place to mention
                the cave lighting, most of which is fluorescent, giving a
                daylight effect. The lights are cunningly concealed behind
                boulder piles thereby harmonising with the natural
                beauties of the cave.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The Sixth Chamber is the most beautiful in the old
                cave, being 45ft. high and 60ft. wide. This chamber is also
                called "The Old Cavebear Cavern" for it was here that most
                of the Bear remains, skulls, bones, etc. were found. After
                passing the deepest point in the cave one climbs a flight
                of steps which lead to The Seventh Chamber. A rear view of
                the cave from this vantage point is a most rewarding
                sight with arrays of formations receding into the distance.
                The Seventh Chamber which marks the end of the Old
                Cave does not contain any formations of note.

                The new cave was found in 1949 by a former cave
                guide, Karl Benz, who now works in a local factory.
                The present-day visitor enters the new series by a
                short flight of steps that have been blasted through a
                large stalagmite flow. There is a bend in the narrow
                passage and suddenly one stands on a balcony overlooking
                a vast chamber covered with the most magnificent
                white stalagmite pillars. This is the new Bärenhöhle,
                the highlight of the cave. These stalagmites just have
                to be seen to be believed. They are not just smooth
                cylinders of calcite but tier upon tier of flowing draperies,
                sparkling and twinkling in the cave lights. As one ascends
                the steps into the Great Hall one is overwhelmed by the size of the
                Chamber, 30ft. high, 100ft. wide and disappearing into the distance
                180ft. away. Everywhere in this Chamber one can see the bones
                of now extinct animals. The lion, bear, etc. bones that have been
                covered with stalactite nearly half an inch thick. In one
                corner a bear's skeleton stands, re-assembled and erected
                (Fig. 1). Mosses and lichens grow beneath the lights to
                form a pretty array, although they are regarded as pests
                as they often grow on formations.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The predominant features of this chamber are the
                pure, snow-white formations, in a diversity of sizes and
                arrays. The tall slender pillars are the main attraction
                but not to be overlooked are the sheets of flowstone on
                the cave walls and the enormous stalagmite bosses 3ft.
                in diameter and 10ft. high with folded draperies around
                the circumference. "Near the end of the Chamber, just
                before the exit is a 60ft. high aven in the roof which
                nearly reaches to the surface. From the base of this aven
                hang many draperies locally known as "Ribs".
                These caves have been the winter haunts of bats from
                time immemorial. Long before Bärenhöhle was discovered multitudes of bats
                lived and died in these caverns, leaving their remains for future archaeologists to find.
                Today the conditions are no longer as favorable
                towards bats as in times gone by. The main reason for
                this being the second exit which causes a change in the
                cave's climate by permitting the cold and warm air to
                circulate through the chambers, affecting both the temperature and
                humidity.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The continuous stream of visitors and the lighting is
                also unfavorable, so that the majority of bats have
                deserted the cave for other haunts. During the many
                years of observation it was found that the number of
                bats in the cave is gradually decreasing but with bats in
                summer quarters this is not the case. This, therefore
                suggests that the disturbance has caused the bats to
                frequent other caves and hiding places.
