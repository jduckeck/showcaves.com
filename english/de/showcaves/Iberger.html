        <p>
            The <b>Iberger Tropfsteinhöhle</b> (Iberg Dripstone Cave) was named after
            its location, it was formed inside the <b>Iberg</b> mountain (563m asl).
            The Iberg is a geologic anomaly, a small island of limestone surrounded by
            crystalline and metamorphic rocks.
            Like the other karst areas of the Harz it is a former reef of the Devonian sea.
            The organisms which formed the reef had skeletons and shells of limestone, the
            sediments which were deposited around the reef in the deeper sea are devoid of
            limestone.
            And like always in such small and isolated karst areas the limestone is
            karstified by water which flows on the surface until it reaches the limestone
            and goes underground.
            Containing little limestone it is able to dissolve a lot of rock thus forming
            caves.
            When it reappears at the lower end of the limestone area in a karst spring, it
            is saturated with limestone.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But there is a second extraordinary geologic feature of this small karst area.
            Generally caves are formed by atmospheric or biogene carbon dioxide, which is
            perceived by the water while it is raining down to the surface and while it
            seeps through the top soil.
            But here, the CO<sub>2</sub> was produced locally, inside the rock, as a by
            product of <b>siderite</b> weathering.
            Siderite is an <b>iron carbonate</b> and is transformed into <b>iron oxide</b>
            and CO<sub>2</sub> by the oxygen in the ground water.
            This CO<sub>2</sub> increases the amount of limestone solution drastically.
            The residual <b>iron oxide</b> formed huge layers inside the caverns.
            During the Middle Ages the area was intensively mined, and the miners were
            looking for the so called <b>mulmige Brauneisenerze</b> (brown iron ore mold)
            inside the caves.
        </p>

        </table>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A special detail of this mechanism are the specific <b>water marks</b>.
            The transformation of siderite into iron oxide was a continuous process, and so
            always a certain amount of CO<sub>2</sub> was solved in the water and able do
            dissolve the limestone of the cavern walls, even if there was no supply from the
            surface.
            Because of this the water marks make sort of upside down steps, and the room
            becomes a little bigger below each water mark.
            In normal karst caves, water marks look more or less like horizontal ditches.
            The solution is restricted to the area around the water surface where mixture
            corrosion with dripping water dissolves some limestone.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The third specialty of the cave are coloured speleothems in one chamber,
            coloured <b>blue green</b> by <b>copper minerals</b>.
            In many karst areas, only iron oxides are available for colouring, and most
            formations look white to brown or sometimes yellowish or reddish.
            Limestone is a marine sediment, which contains only the minerals which are
            typically deposited in such an environment, iron and manganese.
            But if the limestone was alterated by a heavy tectonic action, like here in the
            Harz mountains during the uplift of the whole area, sometimes ores are deposited
            in the cracks.
            The whole process is started by the ascension of magma forming a plutonite, like
            the nearby Brocken mountain.
            The hot magma, stuck inside the earth, heats its surroundings and the ground
            water, which continually dissolves small amounts of various minerals and metals
            in surrounding rocks and re-deposits the ores in cracks.
            It formes polymetallic ores which were mined all over the Harz.

            The caves of the Iberg were discovered by the miners of the Middle Ages.
            They mined the iron ore, used some to fill in overburden, then closed them and
            forgot about them.
            What later became the show cave was never forgotten, it was first mentioned in
            1734, was shown to interested visitors, and finally in 1874 paths and stairs
            were built.
            This is the date when it became a show cave.
            At this time there was only one entrance at the upper end of the cave, almost
            unchanged since early mining.
            In 1911 a new 78m long entrance tunnel was built by Hauptmann <b
                class="smallCaps">Spatzier</b>, and named after him.
            It became the new entrance of the cave, the old entrace was used as exit and the
            tour became a one way tour.
            It was even extended by a new cave discovered while digging the tunnel.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This way the tour stayed almost 100 years, in 2008 the cave was transformed
            again and renamed <b>HöhlenErlebnisZentrum</b>.
            Before the renovation the cave entrance was located above the parking lot in the
            wood, reached on a short walk uphill.
            The exit was even higher up on the hill.
            Both can be seen on the older images on the gallery page.
            The cave entrance is now located on the parking lot, where a two storey entrance
            building was erected.
            The ground floor contains the ticket office, a small shop, caf&eacute; and
            mineral exhibition.
            The second floor contains the archaeologic museum dedicated to the
            <b>Lichtensteinhöhle</b> which is a famous archaeologic site nearby and not
            open to the public.
            The exhibition includes a model of the cave, which gives a good impression of
            the original cave.
            It also show that the cave is actually rather small, the lowest point of the
            model is only 80cm high.
            Not suitable for every tourist, as it requires stooping and crawling, but great
            fun for children.

            The cave tour was also changed, the cave is entered by a new constructed 160m
            long tunnel which leads up to the Hauptmann Spatzier Stollen.
            The tunnel is used for an exhibition showing the geologic development of the
            Harz, the limestone and the karst.
            It reaches the old entrance tunnel right behind the old entrance.
            Visitors take their time to walk uphill through this tunnel, have a look at the
            exhibition, and finally meet their guide at the Hauptmann Spatzier Stollen.

            The first natural cave of the tour was discovered in 1911, during the
            construction of the entrance tunnel.
            There are some nice speleothems and fossils on exhibition, and also some
            speleothems on the ceiling.
            The driping water from the crack in the ceiling is collected in a small
            artificial pool.
            After the remaining part of the tunnel, the main chamber of the cave is reached
            at its deepest point.
            A wide staircase leads up to a first plateau, where the impressive
            <b>watermark</b> can be seen.
            The tour follows some side passages to meet the upper part of the main chamber.
            The main stalagmite is found here, called <b>König Hübich</b> (King
            Hübich), more about this later.
            Here is a steep and narrow staircase leading to the former exit, which is
            actually the oldest entrance to the cave.
            It is closed now, the visitors go back to the lower part of the main chamber and
            then back to the entrance through the tunnels.

            The <b>Iberg Dripstone Cave</b> is a historic show cave, and rather small.
            Despite the name, there are no extraordinary dripstones.
            The name was coined in the 19th century, at this time the name dripstone cave
            was used for any karst cave, it was actually more common.
            The most impressive formation named <b>König Hübich</b> (King
            Hübich) is a huge and massive stalagmite with a thinner and pointy tower on
            top, about 40cm high.
            If you know it, its easy to see that the slim top does not belong to this place.
            It is a part of another stalagmite, probably even a stalactite, which was placed
            here long time ago.
            There is water dripping at this place, depositing limestone, and so the top is
            today fused with the base.

            Before Germany was united in the early 1990s, this was the only well developed
            tourist cave in the western part of the Harz.
            Then the much bigger caves of the eastern part became accessible and the
            importance and visitor numbers diminished.
            In order to stop this process, the cave was completely restructured and
            transformed into what is called <b>HöhlenErlebnisZentrum Iberger
            Tropfsteinhöhle</b>.
            The extensive renovation including the construction of a 160m long tunnel and
            the errection of a two storey building cost 3.85 Millionen Euro.
            It was financed by the European Union, the county Osterode am Harz, the
            Niedersachsen government, the Sparkassenstiftung and other foundations.
            It was executed by the county Osterode am Harz.
            The result is astonishing, almost 60.000 visitors during the first half year.
