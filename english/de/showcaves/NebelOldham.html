            <p>
                The beautiful Nebelhöhle lies in a picturesque part of the Swabian Alb, Germany,
                in a wooded plateau, high above the <b>Echaz Valley</b> and the town of <b>Reutlingen</b>. Spring
                is the best time of the year to visit the cave, when the landscape is shaded by the rich
                green foliage of the Beech woods, which forms a pleasing contrast to the delicate
                pink blossom of the fruit trees.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Every Whitsuntide the ancient <b>Nebelhöhle Feast</b> is held on the Festival Square outside
                the Unterhausen entrance of the cave. Beneath the majestic Beech trees, young and
                old, from near and far, meet again for the traditional peoples' Festival. The Festival
                dates back over 150 years to the time of the former King
                <b class="smallCaps">Friedrich von Württemberg</b>, who
                made a special visit to the cave and the surrounding district.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The cave is only two miles from <b>"Schloss Lichtenstein"</b>,
                one of the many fairy-tale castles for which
                Germany is so famous. The castle has many historic
                associations with the cave, which have been made famous
                by <b>Wilhelm Hauff's</b> well known novel <b>"Lichtenstein"</b>.

            <p class="indentedText">
                Nebelhöhle was one of the first caves to be discovered in Europe.
                A local hunter in the year 1517
                found it by chance, when a roebuck which he shot on the
                mountainside vanished before his eyes into the ground!
                Closer inspection revealed a fissure that opened into a
                cavern. This cleft in the rock was carefully avoided by
                local people, because at frequent intervals the cave
                belched forth dense vapours which clung to the ground
                in the form of a grey mist. This phenomena, which
                gave the cave its name (<b>"Nebel"</b> being German for mist
                or fog), is due to the steady temperature of <b>KFC</b> (50°F)
                prevailing in the cave. If the temperature outside falls
                below this figure, the warmer air in the cave emerges in
                a grey cloud.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                In 1920 two students from Stuttgart discovered the
                "New Nebelhöhle". They had observed a bat flying
                out of a narrow cleft, and thinking that they might
                find a further extension they enlarged the fissure and
                discovered a vast chamber containing an abundance of
                crystal white pillars. At first, the "New Cave" could
                only be viewed separately because the "Old Cave" was
                situated under the district of <b>Unterhausen</b> and the "New
                Cave" under that of <b>Genkingen</b>. But, fortunately, in
                1934, the two municipalities reached an agreement
                whereby a passage was made between the two caves.
                This made one grand system with a combined length of
                1500 ft. and a depth of 150 ft. below the surface at the
                lowest point.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Today the cave is entered from the Genkingen end,
                via a flight of steps, which lead into the passage way
                between the 1st and 2nd Halls. The 1st Hall is not
                generally shown to the public as it does not contain any
                formations, but the 2nd Hall presents an idea of what is
                in store.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Although many of the formations in this chamber
                are dry and lifeless they still form a pleasing array. The
                2nd Hall is connected to the 3rd Hall by a short passage.
                The 3rd Hall is known as The Hall of Columns, and
                is the showpiece of the cave. It consists of a superbly
                decorated chamber 150 ft. long and 60 ft. wide, which is
                literally packed with hundreds of both slender and
                massive stalagmites, most of which are 10-12 ft. high.
                glistening white and sparking with water. (Fig. 1)
                Because of their resemblance to living things and famous
                places many of these formations have been given names.
                such as "The Owl", and "The Castle of Lichtenstein".
                As these formations are in the "New Nebelhöhle" they
                are still as bright and fresh looking as the day they were
                discovered. Untarnished by the smoke of oil lamps, and
                with only the electric light to remind us of the intrusion
                of man, they remain a fitting tribute to the works of
                nature.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The 4th Hall is the final chamber in the "New Cave".
                and although it contains an ornamental grotto, it is
                rather an anti-climax after the foregoing splendours of
                "The Hall of Columns". There are some boulders on the
                floor of this chamber which fell from the roof thousands
                of years ago and now have pretty little stalagmites
                growing on them. The passage turns to the right.
                through a narrow opening which has been blasted out of
                the white Jurassic limestone. It was at this point that the
                discoverers of the "New Nebelhöhle" saw the bat flying
                out of a narrow cleft.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The first thing that the visitor notices is the sudden
                change in the cave’s appearance. For centuries this part
                of the cave was illuminated by torches of brushwood and
                consequently the walls and formations are no longer
                sparkling white like those of the "New Cave" but are a
                dark grey.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                On the left a side passage leads to <b>Ulrich's</b> Cave.
                It was in this cave in 1519 that Duke <b>Ulrich von Württemberg</b>
                is reputed to have hidden whilst being pursued by
                the <b>Swabian Farmers' Confederacy</b>. He spent a total
                of 21 days in this cave. going each evening to the nearby
                Castle of <b>Lichtenstein</b>, and returning to the cave at day
                break. The so-called Ulrich’s Cave lies 70 ft. above and
                immediately over the main passage. It consists of two
                small chambers nearly 200 ft. long containing a few
                formations. Access to Ulrich’s Cave is today via a
                flight of concrete steps and an iron ladder. It is probably
                much easier to visit this cave now than in Ulrich’s time.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The 5th Hall, the final chamber, is the largest one
                in the cave. It is about 300 ft. long and in places over
                60 ft. high. The largest formation in the chamber is
                called "The Pulpit and Organ". "The Pulpit" is a large.
                tall stalagmite and "The Organ" a huge stalagmite boss.
                15 ft. in diameter and surrounded by a fine array of
                stalactites resembling organ pipes (Fig. 2). Just in front
                of "The Organ" at floor level is the stump of a giant
                stalagmite 3 ft. in diameter. This has been cut off just
                above floor level and polished to show the <b>circular
                growth</b> rings (Fig. 3) which resemble the annular rings
                of a tree. Nearby is a small lake which is usually about
                3 ft. deep in summer, but in winter the water rises to
                over 9 ft. There are no active streams in the cave.
                possibly due to the comparatively high altitude (2500 ft.
                above sea level) although the cave was probably formed
                by the river <b>Echaz</b> or one of its tributaries, thousands of
                years ago when the Echaz flowed across the plateau of
                the Alb.

                Many famous people have visited Nebelhöhle.
                including the poet <b>Ludwig Uhland</b>, who wrote the
                following immortal words after his visit:
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                <b>"Doch in der Höhle wo die stille Kraft<br>
                    des Erdgeists rätselhafte Formen schafft.<br>
                    im Fackellicht der Phantasie entfaltet,<br>
                    sehen wir wie Heldenbildern sie gestaltet<br>
                    und jeder Halle, in Spalt and Kluft versteckt<br>
                    ward zum beseelten Menschenwort erweckt."</b>
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                This may he freely translated as:
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                But in the cave where the silent power<br>
                Of the earthspirit creates mysterious forms,<br>
                In the torchlight the imagination is unfolded,<br>
                We see the figures of heroes<br>
                Hidden in every hall, in space and cleft.<br>
                They are aroused by the animated word of man.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                These sentences are preserved for ever on a Bronze
                Plaque at the Unterhausen entrance as a silent witness
                to the beauty of these depths.
