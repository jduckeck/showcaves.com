<h2>History</h2>




<br clear="all">



<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
In Roth, a small village belonging to Gerolstein two <i>"caves"</i> can be
found.
This common language term does not really fit, as this are not natural caves,
this are tunnels or ubnderground quarries created long time ago during millstone
quarrying.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The <b>Eishöhle</b> (Ice Cave) is a simple tunnel, leading downwards.
Because of this form it is a so-called <b>cold trap</b>: cold air wich is
heavier flows into the cave and is trapped there.
During winter the cave cools down below zero, and in summer the warm air from
outside is not able to enter because it is lighter.
There is no second entrance, so there is no flow of air.
Also the surrounding deciduous forest with its trees provides shadow, the porous
basalt is a good insulation, and the cave is located on a north-facing slope.
The average temperatur of the tunnel is below 0°C, and the ice which forms
during winter stays until summer.
Around June generally the last remains of the ice melt, but the cave remains
exceptionally cool all year.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Folowing the main tunnel which goes steep down from the entrance we reach two
subsequent chambers.
The second chamber contains some unfinished millstones, which are an impressive
proof of the former millstone production.
The ice was also mined, as it was known near and far.
During the 17th century the Kurfürsten von Köln were delivered with
ice from here.
And during the Aachener Kongress (Congress of Aachen) in the year 1815 the ice
was from this tunnel.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The cave is open without restrictions, but because of the steep entrance and the
ice on the floor it is rather difficult to visit.
We recommend good sturdy boots, warm clothes, several lamps and a lot of
wariness.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Right beneath the ice cave lies the <b>Mühlsteinhöhle</b> (Millstone
Cave).
Obviously of same origin and age, it was named after the millstone mining which
created the tunnels.
The first quarring happend during pre-Roman times, continued over centuries but
with numerous long pauses.
The Romans used an early kind of millstone, called rubbing stone, where the
grains were grinded to flour by a round rock which was moved on a flat plate,
both created from basalt.
The quarrying of milstones started during the 13th century and ended with the 30
Years War.
Only a very small number of quarries was active afterwards.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The quarrying started on the surface, but when following the best quality basalt
it soon moved underground.
The millstones were marked as circles on the wall and the a circular
pre-millstone cut into the wall.
The furrow around the millstone was cut deeper and deeper until the millstone
fell off the wall by its own weight.
Then it was moved out and cut into its final form on the surface.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The mining at this place ended when the entrance collapsed.
The tunnel was inaccessible for centuries, until the collapse was discovered by
the priest Pfarrer <b class="smallCaps">Weiler</b>.
He started to dig in 1905 and discovered the old mining tunnel in 1907.
The modern entrance is not the original entrance, it is the tunnel created by
the priest.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
There is a third cave in the area called <b>Drachenhöhle</b> (Dragons
Cave).
It is mentioned in literature, but not signposted in contrary to the other two
caves.
Those are developed for the public in the sense that there are signs and
explanatory texts at the entrance.
For some reason they are bi-lingual, in German and Netherlands.
The Mühlsteinhöhle is closed by an iron grate, but there is no
explanation why.
Probably to protect bats or because of the dangers of the tunnel.
