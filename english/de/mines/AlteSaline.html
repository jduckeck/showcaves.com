        <h2>Geology</h2>

        <p>
        </p>


        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The <b>Alte Saline</b> (Old Salt Works) in Bad Reichenhall is, as the name suggests, a facility in which salty water, i.e. brine, was vaporised by heating and salt was extracted in this way.
            It is a historic building that was rebuilt under King <b class="smallCaps">Ludwig I</b> after the devastating town fire of 1834.
            In the 20th century, a modern salt works was built in Bad Reichenhall and the Old Salt Works was converted into a salt museum.
            We added this museum quite late to <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span> because we only list museums in certain cases.
            That was obviously a big mistake, because this museum is not just mining-related, it actually has an underground section, a historical mine of a very special kind, and is therefore a real show mine, not just a museum.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But let's start chronologically.
            There have always been brine springs in Reichenhall, which have certainly been used since prehistoric times.
            The first documented mention of brewing pans dates back to the 7th century, when Bavarian Duke <b class="smallCaps">Theodor II</b> presented Bishop <b class="smallCaps">Rupertus of Salzburg</b> with 20 "Pfannstädel" and a third of the spring water in 696.
            Salt was white gold, of considerable value, and so the mining rights were highly coveted.
            There were countless disputes over ownership claims, mining rights and customs duties.
            Until the end of the 15th century, the springs and the evaporation pans were in the possession of numerous different owners, both ecclesiastical and secular.
            This came to an end when Duke <b class="smallCaps">George the Rich</b> and Duke <b class="smallCaps">Albrecht IV</b> acquired all the brewing sites in the hands of the bourgeois boilers, a monumental endeavour that took almost 50 years from 1483 to 1532.
            Finally, they had the technical facilities completely modernized.
            Salt production increased continuously, so that firewood had to be brought in from continually increasing distances.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Elector <b class="smallCaps">Karl Theodor</b> streamlined the entire production process between 1782 and 1798, further increasing production while reducing energy consumption and firewood demand.
            The salt works functioned well and efficiently, so what could be more obvious than to process the brine extracted 15 km away in Berchtesgaden here as well.
            As early as 1816, King <b class="smallCaps">Max I</b> and his minister, Count <b class="smallCaps">Montgelas</b>, commissioned the royal Bavarian salt works councillor <b class="smallCaps">Georg von Reichenbach</b> to build a brine pipeline.
            The result is a technical masterpiece.
            A devastating town fire destroys most of the facilities in Reichenhall in 1834.
            The salt works were rebuilt under King <b class="smallCaps">Ludwig I</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The new building is an industrial building, but at the beginning of the 19th century this term had a different meaning.
            The architects <b class="smallCaps">Joseph Daniel Ohlmüller</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Friedrich von Gärtner</b> built the "most beautiful salt works in the world".
            But the building is not only beautiful to look at, it is also the oldest existing continental salt works in Europe.
            And although the salt springs still bubble to this day, salt production was moved to a more modern salt works in 1929.
            The salt works now houses the salt museum, and it is possible to visit the tunnel system and the brine springs.
            The <b>Salzmuseum</b> (salt museum) has five sections with different themes.
            The so-called <b>Markenmuseum</b> (brand museum) shows the history of the Bad Reichenhaller brand.
            The medical properties of salt, iodine and folic acid are also explained.
            In the Bad Reichenhaller salt shop you can buy the complete range of table salt.
            The highlight of the visit, however, is the <b>Brunnhauskapelle</b> (Brunnhaus Chapel), which was rebuilt by <b class="smallCaps">Joseph Daniel Ohlmüller</b> in neo-Byzantine style.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But the special thing is the technical side.
            A 5 km long pipeline from the mountain valleys of the Lattenberg brings the water to drive the overshot water wheels.
            With a diameter of 13 m and a weight of 13 t, they turn 3.5 times a minute.
            The water flows off at the surface, but the power is transferred underground using rods.
            Another water wheel is driven by an underground freshwater river.
            It is undershot due to the lack of a gradient.
            It transfers its power to a 103 m long rod with deflection levers to the <b>Karl-Theodor-Pumpe</b> (Karl Theodor pump).
            This raises the brine from the spring 6 m and then it flows through a channel at the bottom of the tunnel to the main shaft.
            At the beginning, the salt content was 24 %, but has decreased considerably over time.
            The brine is therefore only used for spa purposes.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A special highlight is the <b>Salzgrotte</b> (salt grotto), a natural cave with a floor area of around 280 m² and a height of 5 m.
            It was discovered back in 1795 during the construction of the test tunnel.
            A natural salt cave is quite exceptional and extermely rare, and in Germany this is probably the only one.
        </p>
