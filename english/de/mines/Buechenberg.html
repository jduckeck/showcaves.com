                This mine provided a memorable array of minerals which are unique in
                Central Europe. The range of colours in the minerals and local stone
                fascinates the layman. Such is the diversity of geological features,
                that walking only a few meters through the mine takes the visitor through
                a long geological time span. Most notably is the green volcanic
                Ergussgesteine (lava) of the Middle Devonian, formed by hot volcanic
                springs in the bottom of the sea, 360 million years ago. This contrasts
                with the reddish iron ore which is sandwich between the black tuff
                (volcanic ash).
            </p>

                A full range of mining equipment is on display. Overhead loaders,

                A 600 m long circular tour, which is suitable even for wheelchair users,
                gives a good impression of the work of an iron miner in the 1950s and
                1960s when the mine was located in the German Democratic Republic.

            <p class="indentedText">
                The ore was carted from the mine via a 8.65 km long aerial ropeway.
                Modern production technology demonstrates how the steeply sloping strata
                was excavated. The safety device which guarded against rope breaks is
                demonstrated.

            Büchenberg is a rather young mine, although it has a very long history.
            The most important time of the mine was during the 1950s and 1960s, and most of the machinery is from this time.
            This is exceptional for a German mine, as most of them became unprofitable at the same time and were closed.
            Many others, especially in the Harz, were already closed for centuries.
            The reason is the extremely rich and big deposit, and the economic situation of East Germany, which tried to produce as much as possible on theri own, to spare foreign currency.
        </p>

        <figure class="right">
            <a data-lightbox="page" data-title="the so called <b>Geologic Window</b>, the highlight of every tour." href="../../../images/Big/D076-127.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../../images/D076-127.jpg"></a>
            <figcaption>the so called <b>Geologic Window</b>, the highlight of every tour.</figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p class="indentedText">
            The mine was exploited using contemporary techniques, the machinery was state of the art.
            Even the transport of the ore was extraordinary: the location on top of the mountain did not allow the construction of a railroad access, which would have been the most economic transport for the ore.
            The next station was nearly 10 km away at the foot of the Harz.
            So they built an aerial ropeway to transport the ore from the shaft 50 m inside the mine downhill to the train station, where the content of the carts was automatically turned over into the train.
            At this time the ropeway was the longest industrial ropeway of Europe, being 8,650 m long.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The entrance builing of the minig is right at the ropeway, contains the ticket office and a small museum.
            Minerals, ores and some models of the mine are on display, also historic documents and photographs.
            After a short introduction the visitors get a helmet and the tour starts.
            The mine is entered down the steep tunnel of the ropeway, disabled visitor can use a modern funicular.
            At the bottom the first highlight of the tour is the ropeway filling station, were hunts from the mine were filling huge silos, which then filled the carts of the ropeway.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The whole tour follows a single level of the mine.
            So it is also level and suitable for disabled.
            Still it is cool, damp, sometimes a little low and dirty.
            Appropriate clothes and shoes are a good idea.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The most impressive highlight of the tour is a so called <b>geologic window</b>.
            It is not really a window, as it is just the wall of an adit, but the colourfull layers of ore and other rocks make it an imortant geologic point in the mine.
            The layers are folded into cones, and so the tunnels normally followed the conic surfaces.
            Here at this point the adit cuts through the conic layers of ore.
        </p>


        <h3>About the "Tzscherperessen"</h3>

            <a data-lightbox="page" data-title="this overhead loader is in full working order, driven by compressed air, and demonstrated on the tour." href="../../../images/Big/D076-124.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../../images/D076-124.jpg"></a>

        <p>
            The Harz mountains are rather high, cold and not very fertile.
            First usage during the Middle Ages was cutting wood and herding sheep or cattle.
            But soon the first minerals and ores were found, and the first open cast mines built.
            The iron ore at the Büchenberg was mined for a long time.
            But when the local sovereigns tried to improve their mining activities, they had to get skilled miners, who were able to build underground mines.
            The first miners which came to the Harz in a huge number were from the Erzgebirge, another mountain area to the south, which belongs half to Germany and half to the Czech Republic today.
            They brought with them their knowledge, culture and language.
            And so today the dialect spoken in the Harz differs from the flatland around.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A strange word, which might not be found in a German dictionary, and which most Germans will not know is the word <b>Tscherper</b>.
            It is a typical miners word of the local dialect.
            A <b>Tzscherper</b> is a knife, a sort of general purpose tool used by the miners.
            Every miner had one and used it for repairing things, e.g. the <b>Geleucht</b>
            (lamp) or his shoes, machinery or tools like <b>Schlegel</b> and <b>Eisen</b>
            (hammer and chisel).
            It was also used to score the rock to determine if it is ore or any other kind of rock.
            And last but not least it was used to eat, slice bread, cut meat or to butter bread.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A modern remains of this tradition is the so called <b>Tzscherperessen</b>
            (Tzscherper meal), which is a meal which resembles the miners meals.
            It consists of a potato soup (probably not eaten using the knife) and traditional local food like (very fat) sausages, ham and cheese.
            Typical are <b>Bratwurst</b>, a sausage made for frying in a pan,
            <b>Leberwurst</b> (liver sausage) and <b>Rotwurst</b>, a sausage made of blood and greaves.
            Of course there is a lot of Schnaps necessary to survive this meal.
            Typical are potato Schnaps, similar to Wodka, and lokal cordials like Schierker Feuerstein.
            All those sausages were once made only once a year, when a pig was butchered.
            And the original Tzscherperessen was also made only once a year at Himmelfahrt
            (Ascension Day).
            It was a special festival of the miners.
            The food was typical but still something special.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Today there is no problem to get all those sausages all over the year, and Tzscherperessen are held inside the Büchenberg mine all year.
            The low temperature of 8 °C and a humidity of 95% make it a rather cool experience, and warm clothes are much recommended.
            After some time the Schnaps will also help.
            There are other places were the Tzscherperessen is held, but this is definitely the most extraordinary location.
