        <h2>Geology</h2>

        <p>
            The <b>Litermont</b> is a 414 m high elevation north-east of Dillingen/Saar, between the villages of Düppenweiler, Nalbach and Hüttersdorf.
            It is evidence of Permian volcanism in the area of today’s Saar-Nahe highlands.
            The hill forms an elevation because it consists of weather-resistant <b>rhyolite</b>.
            It was formed during the <b>Saalian phase</b> of mountain formation around 275 million years ago.
            This "small" mountain formation phase was postulated by <b class="smallCaps">Hans Stille</b> in 1924 and separates the Lower and Upper Rotliegend, which is why Rotliegend is also named Dyas, the "two parted".
            Nevertheless, the distinction of the two layers is very difficult.
            In any case, tectonic movements occurred, and magma penetrated between older rock layers and cooled relatively slowly.
        </p>


        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The copper deposit on the Weltersberg was discovered in 1723 by a farmer named <b class="smallCaps">Junkmann</b> while ploughing.
            Copper mining in Düppenweiler began two years later with the Walloon <b class="smallCaps">Remacle Renard Joseph des Hauzeur</b>, who recruited experienced miners from the Erzgebirge (Ore Mountains).
            He was so successful that a rumour claimed that he had also found a vein of gold.
            After a while, however, the mine water became so abundant that he had to install pumps.
            A horse engine was installed to drive the pumps.
            Disputes arose, as a result of which the mine was forced to shut down.
            The Imperial Baron Johann Wilhelm Ludwig von Hagen zur Motten filed a lawsuit against the Elector of Trier at the Imperial Court of Justice in Vienna over the copper mine.
            Following a ruling by the courts of Koblenz and Trier, the mine was shut down until the matter was resolved.
            As a result, <b class="smallCaps">Hauzeur</b> probably left Düppenweiler between 1730 and 1735.
            The legal dispute continued, and it was only over 20 years later that it was ended with a settlement before the Imperial Court of Justice in Vienna in 1757.
            The baronial von Hagen family received the copper mine as a fief from the Elector of Trier and reopened it.
            Soon afterwards, they leased it to <b class="smallCaps">Jean Helle de Doffinée</b>, who soon had it shut down.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A decade later, in 1769, <b class="smallCaps">Franz Georg von Zandt</b> and his partner <b class="smallCaps">de Gersonne</b> put the plant back into operation.
            They discovered further rich copper ore deposits.
            However, they also had problems with the large amount of mine water, which ultimately caused them to fail.
            The operators changed several more times, and all of them failed due to the ingress of water.
            As early as 1776, the then operator Marquis <b class="smallCaps">de Gerin</b> had the idea of using an atmospheric steam engine to lift the water.
            Unfortunately, his company went bankrupt before the steam engine was ready for operation.
            Finally, <b>Dillinger Hütte</b> took over during <b class="smallCaps">Napoleon</b>’s occupation, interrupted by the turmoil of war and hampered by changing regulations.
            Finally, <b class="smallCaps">Napoleon</b> himself granted a concession for 50 years, but the turmoil of war with the fall of <b class="smallCaps">Napoleon</b> ended this mining phase.
            From 1824 to 1828, the Dillinger Hütte mined again, but was also unable to reach the lower levels with its ore, despite the use of a steam engine.
            It therefore gave up mining due to a lack of mineable ore and closed the mine in 1828.
            Further attempts to reopen the mine were rejected.
            The last resumption of mining, which was probably due to the lack of raw materials caused by the First World War, was also unsuccessful and short-lived.
            Dillinger Hütte finally closed the mine for good in 1916.
            For some reason, they repeatedly extended the licence until 1993.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The idea of turning the mine into a show mine emerged in the 1980s.
            On 08-OCT-1986, the then head of the village submitted the first application to reopen the old mine workings for this purpose.
            The tunnel was reopened in this year by the municipality.
            The <b>Förderverein Historisches Bergwerk Düppenweiler e.V.</b> (copper mine development association) took over the responsibility in 1992.
            After the concession of the Dillinger Hütte finally expired in 1993, they were granted an operating licence for the show cave.
            First the Hüttenschacht, then the Selloschacht and Hauzeurschacht and the associated tunnels were made accessible.
            A miners chapel, the Barbara Chapel, shaft roofs and the shaft house of the Hauzeurschacht were built above ground.
            The show mine was finally opened in 1995 and has been extended several times since then.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The complex consists of the <b>Huthaus</b>, which houses a restaurant and a small mining museum, the entrance shaft to the copper mine, the copper smelter, the foundations of the steam engine and the chapel of St Barbara.
            There are several car parks and a Kneipp facility at the Huthaus.
            Guided tours of the mine site and the copper smelter are available by appointment, but only on Sundays.
            Of course, the open-air site can also be visited without a guided tour, information boards provide visitors with information about the facilities.
            An unguided tour of the stamping plant is also possible, a turnstile allows access after inserting a coin.
            A so-called media terminal explains the copper smelter and the further processing of the ore.
            Three films are also shown.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The landmark of the mine is probably the <b>miner’s Christmas pyramid</b> or mine pyramid.
            This is a larger-than-life replica of a pyramid from the Ore Mountains.
            This wooden Christmas decoration rotates as warm air rises from four candles and drives a propeller.
            This is probably a not so subtle reference to the fact that the first miners came from the Ore Mountains, both from Saxony and Bohemia.
            Both customs and the miners' language have survived to this day.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Guided tours of the mine take place on weekends during the summer months, while the restaurant is open all year round.
            The show mine consists of 600 m of tunnels, mostly 80 cm wide and up to 2 m high, and four shafts with depths ranging from 10 m to 19 m.
            You enter through the <b>Barbaraschacht</b> and reach the <b>dome</b> where ore mining is shown.
            In the <b>machine shaft</b>, dewatering is thematised.
            The geology of the mine is explained at the <b>underground lake</b>.
            During the tour, the hardworking daily life of the miners is presented, as are the legends surrounding copper mining at Litermont.

        <p class="indentedText">
            In addition to irregular events, the <b>Düppenweiler Schmelzertage</b> (Düppenweiler smelter days) take place every year on the weekend after Ascension Day.
            The historic copper smelting plant with a stamp mill and smelter is fully functional and is demonstrated on these days.
            You can see the bellows, all three smelting furnaces and the cooking furnace in operation.
            The entire smelting process is demonstrated, just as it was in the 18th century.
