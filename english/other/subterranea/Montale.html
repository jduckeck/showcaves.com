        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Galleria Montale</b> (Montale Tunnel) is an abandoned railroad tunnel.
            In 1932, a narrow gauge electric railway service was opened from Rimini on the coast to San Marino City.
            It operated the Italian one-meter gauge, which is the typical size of narrow gauge railroads in Italy.
            The area is quite mountainous and so the winding track required the construction of 18 tunnels within the Republic of San Marino.
            The railroad is more like a tram, and it was intended primarily for tourists, offering a way for the tourists at the beaches to travel to San Marino for a day trip.
            With an elevation gain of 643 m and great views, the ride itself was an attraction.
            The railroad was built in only three years, with the work of 3,000 workers, and without massive technology.
            The train does not have any special technology, such as a rack railway, to cope with the incline, so the tracks could not exceed a certain gradient.
            That was the reason why the tracks made several loops, and so many tunnels were necessary.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The railroad was closed during World War II, and never reopened.
            The beginning of this story was a "mistake", as San Marino had declared neutrality in World War II.
            On 26-JUN-1944 the Allied dropped 225 bombs on the tiny state, 63 people died, hundreds of people were injured, and the railroad was massively damaged.
            But the trains were used to accommodate wounded and displaced people in the tunnels.
            Much of the infrastructure was damaged during the fighting in the area.
            The tunnels were used as air raid shelters for the locals from this day.
            For the refugees a train was placed inside the tunnel, so they could sit in the waggon instead of the cold wet tracks outside.
            By the way, <b class="smallCaps">Winston Churchill </b> later apologized for the mistake.
        </p>


        <p class="indentedText">
            After the war the roads were improved, and so the railroad became obsolete, it was never reopened.
            Much of the railroad tracks on the surface are gone, but the tunnels still exist.
            The railroad has been restored since 2011, and some trains were repaired and work again.
            Now San Marino has the shortest railroad of the world with 800 m of tracks.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Associazione Treno Bianco Azzurro</b> (Blue White Train Association) is named after the typical colour of the trams.
            They were blue in the lower half and white in the upper.
            The association has the dream to reconstruct the railroad completely and offer regular trips again, on the 32 km between Rimini and San Marino.
            They think not only locals would use the tram, it would also be a good way to get to San Marino as a tourist, no need to find a parking lot.
            And it would be a tourist attraction in its own right.
            Their reasoning seems valid, however, there are also massive problems.
            At the moment they offer tram rides on the short remaining or reconstructed part of the tracks on special days.
            The Galleria Montale is well developed and has several educational signs explaining the background.
            The restored tram is also placed here.
            On the open days there is electric light in the tunnel.
            However, the tunnel is freely accessible, and you may visit the tunnel and the tram any time you like.
            But the light is off, and you should bring a lamp, and it’s not possible to enter the tram.
        </p>
