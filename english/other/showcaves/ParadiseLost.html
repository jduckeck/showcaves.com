        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The caves <b>Paradise Lost</b> were discovered by <b class="smallCaps">Joseph Mbai</b> and some of his farmhands in 1996.
            An exploration and excavation by archeologists from the National Museum of Kenya revealed 8,000 to 12,000 years old human remains.
            Black pieces of stone were actually obsidian rock artefacts from the Late Stone Age.
            The caves are shelters, eroded by the water of the nearby Gichi river.
            They are located behind a 3.5 m wide waterfall.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            And it is one of only two show caves in the country.
            The cave was obviously known to people several thousand years ago but then forgotten.
            It was rediscovered by <b class="smallCaps">Joseph Mbai</b>, the farmer who owned this farm, in 1996.
            The National Museum of Kenya excavated the cave, so they obviously needed trails and light for their work.
            He somehow got the idea that he could show the cave to others (and earn some money) and he opened the cave as a show cave.
            The trails and electric light were not great but better than any other cave in the country.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            We listed the cave in 2001, which is only 5 years after its discovery, however, we were not able to determine when it was actually opened.
            Over the years the site was completed by a playground and toilets, boat rides, archery, horse rides, camel rides, zip line rides, and quad bikes rides.
            Quite a bunch of rides.
            They called it <b>Kenya's Largest Picnic Site</b>.
            And they introduced rather steep prices and raised them recently, the result were numerous bad reviews on the web.
            We read some pages about the cave and found so much weird stuff, that we think the price is justified by the weirdness.
            The site obviously charges a steep entrance fee or day use fee.
            The cave and any other activity inside is charged extra.
            People were quite enraged, that the playground for the children cost extra.
            But now, lets start with the weirdness, and it's a really long list.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Weirdness 1: it has an underground lake which is "the largest underground lake ever found so far, even though it is not as big as those...in the US and Mexico".
            Is it the biggest lake or not?
            Such superlatives are even then nonsense if they are less quirky.
            But being the biggest cave lake <b>despite</b> there being bigger lakes, how does that work?
            And by the way, the cave has no underground lake at all.
            There is an artificial lake in front of the cave which was created by a dam.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Weirdness 2: in 2005 a foreigner came and claimed that he was the owner of the caves, and as he was wealthy he just took over and renamed the caves <b>Paradise Regained</b>.
            However, the case went to court, and it decided that <b class="smallCaps">Joseph Mbai</b> was the owner of the land.
            We obviously lack some essential details of the story.
            We can guess it has something to do with the history of the country, and the land was never registered officially, might be a thing in an African country.
            And after the lawsuit the land was finally registered.
            Living in a country where since 150 years everything is registered by the state automatically, that's hard to understand.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Weirdness 3: the cave behind is a karst cave of some size.
            It has notable speleothems including stalactites, stalagmites, columns, draperies, and calcite crystals.
            On other pages they state it's an erosional cave.
            As far as we can see it's an erosional cave and has no speleothems at all, it is rather small and only 50 m long.
            The shelters at the entrance are obviously a result of the retrograde erosion of the waterfall.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Weirdness 4: the owner describes that he was quite impressed when he found old mining tools and equipment scattered throughout the cave.
            <i>"It’s amazing to think about all the work that went into mining this cave and how long it must have taken."</i>
            Just to repeat the obvious: this is dubbed a cave and as such it was not created by mining, it was naturally created.
            Someone probably mined bat guano as a fertilizer, and that means by the way it was not discovered by the farmer, it was well known before.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Weirdness 5: they claim that the cave was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
            We guess they forgot to tell UNESCO, there is no hint that it was listed.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Weirdness 6: they have a website now, which has no address on the contact page, just the sketch how to get there without comments, no phone numer.
            And after clicking two or three times the site says <i>There has been a critical error on this website. Learn more about troubleshooting WordPress.</i>
            Its really hard to break WordPress, this requires skills.
            The short description of the site is about half a page and contains the word Kenya 11 times, some sentences use it twice.
            We did not learn much about the site, but now we guess it actually is <b>not</b> in Kenya, probably it's in the Twilight Zone.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Weirdness 7: the caves were used by the Mau Mau as a hideout in the 1960s.
            Thay are even called Mau Mau Caves, which is strange because there are actually caves in Kenya which go by this name.
            And just to get it right: the caves were known to stone age man, to the Mau Mau, only the owner was unaware?
            And you should actually know that the Mau Mau revolt was in 1952, if you live in Kenya.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave obviously has a long history, there were archaeological remains, traces of mining and Mau Mau.
            The only one who did not know about the cave was the owner of the land, until he finally found them.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Due to lack of actual facts we can only speculate about the origins of the cave.
            We were not able to find any paper about the excavation, which would have shed some light on the situation.
            They state that there were obsidian pieces in the rock, and they were used by stone age man.
            And there was volcanic activity 2.4 Million years ago.
            Our best guess is: the shelters at the waterfall are created by erosion, the soft volcanic tufa in the shelter was mined by prehistoric man for obsidian.
            The 50 m long tunnel is actually a prehistoric obsidian mine.
            Similar mines for flint are known from Europe.
        </p>
