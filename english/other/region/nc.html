            <p>
                This former French colony is a very mountainous Pacific island with a limestone karst of considerable potential.
                <b>New Caledonia</b>, the <b>Loyalty Islands</b> and the <b>Isle of Pines</b> have a karst area of over 2,000 square km.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Only a small fraction of the underworld has been explored and a hundred or so caverns have been listed, so there is much potential for further underground investigation.
                Some of the caves are accessible to keen tourists, as long as they are careful and respect the beauty of the sites.
                Others are reserved for speleologists with a penchant for adventure.
                Visiting caves usually requires the presence of a local guide and the need to bring your own lights.
                Many caves are on private or holy land, so remember to ask for permission from local authorities.
            </p>


            <h2>The Mainland</h2>

            <p>
                The karst landscapes of the mainland were formed about 60 million years ago.
                There are some important caves at Yaté.
            </p>

            <h3>Yaté</h3>

            <p>
                The Touaourou caves have the curious feature of a vault pierced through by the roots of Banyan trees which form veritable curtains.
                They are easy to visit.
                You must simply ask for permission from the neighbouring tribe.
                Still in Yaté, a short walk along the coast leads to the entrance of the Wekou siphon and the impressive eddy which it causes at high tide.
            </p>


            <h3>Poya</h3>

            <p>
                <b>Adio Cave</b> L 6 km is the longest in New Caledonia.
                For more than 50 years, a Melanesian guide, Albert Gorodite, has been leading visitors into the bowels of the earth.
                He is easily found by asking at the Poya town hall.
                The main network follows a subterranean riverbed for about 3 km, which represents 3 hours of walking, before emerging lower down in the forest.
                The first 150 meters involve wading, and is it difficult to avoid getting wet.
                This leads to the great gallery of the cave. It measures about 10 meters in diameter.
                In various places tributaries flow into the main stream, these are subterranean rivers yet to be fully explored.
                A visit to the cave is only for very fit people who are not afraid of getting completely wet through.
                The cave contains some very beautiful speleothems which are extremely fragile and very rare.
                Great care should be taken to avoid damaging them.
                There are numerous chambers, narrow corridors beneath dripping vaults, and at the end a fun labyrinth with a forced bath in very clear waters.
            </p>


            <h3>Koumac and Kaala-Gomen</h3>

            <p>
                Situated 10 km from the west coast, the massif of Koumac covers a surface area of about 20 km² and its highest peak rises to 374 m asl.
                It is intersected by a canyon and the Koumac river and features two major phenomena: the Poultier hole and the Koumac cave.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The <b>Poultier hole</b> is a vast closed off depression 3 km long and 200 meters deep.
                Karst towers dominate this depression which constitutes one of the most beautiful landscapes in New Caledonia.
                Two riverbeds run through it: the "Great Forest" river to the west and the "Poultier River" to the east.
                WARNING: during heavy rainfall, these generally dry rivers are capable of receiving very large quantities of water, so you should not venture into them during flood times as the flow-rate can get up to 100 m² per second.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                <b>The Koumac Cave</b>. L 3.7 km The route is quite easy and the complete visit, to this very beautiful cave, takes about 3 hours.
                In December 8, 2000 the cave appeared on a stamp issued by the postal authorities.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The Kaala-Gomen massif covers a surface area of about 10 km².
                It has been very little explored and does not appear to contain a large system.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The minor karsts: <b>Hienghène</b> and <b>Houailou</b>
                These diverse karst areas are of small size and the caves found there are modest.
                The great hall of the Lindéralique cave in Hienghène, is worth a detour for its size and location.
                In Houailou, the little Nindhia massif encloses a cave of about 100 m long.
                It was explored in 1975 by Australians.
            </p>


            <h2>L'île des Pins</h2>

            <p>
                This island in the South province contains ten or more caves, most of which contain active underground rivers.
                Only a few of them are open to the public:
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The <b>Oumagne cave</b>: it is possible to explore the first 200 meters, up to a small chamber that ends in a collapse.
                At the end you can find a flat platform which once served as a bed for Queen Hortense.
                At this point the river disappears underground and can only be explored by experienced speleologists who can continue another 1,000 meters into the Ouatchia cave: this site is taboo for some.
                This is where Queen Hortense supposedly hid before abdicating in 1883.
            </p>


            <h2>Les Iles Loyauté</h2>

            <p>
                The Loyalty Islands are of great interest to cavers. It seems that caves
                were formed as recently as 300,000 years ago, when the sea level was 120
                meters above its current level. Following one of the great events of our
                recent geological past, the glaciations, which had the effect of
                solidifying the ocean into ice, the lowest point was reached: 15,000
                years ago when the sea level was 100 meters below the current level.
                Rainwater infiltrated the massif and ran out into the ocean, carving out
                passages at the same level as the that of the ocean. Each time the ocean
                level dropped, more caves were formed. It is these caves that are being
                discovered today. The deepest and most recent caves are therefore 100
                meters below the current sea level. The rising water table which took
                place during the last fifteen thousand years was spectacular. The
                deepest caves were completely submerged and are now channels through
                which water penetrates inland.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                On these coral islands, most of the caves are holy sites. Visiting caves
                is not a very well developed tourist activity. This has allowed the many
                limestone concretions that form fragile mineral sculptures to be
                preserved. However, informed tourists can visit some caves with a guide.
            </p>


            <h3>Ouvea</h3>

            <p>
                The island of Ouvea has 23 caves. They are of course difficult places to
                visit as they are not suitable for tourists. However, if you are an
                experienced cave diver, make sure you get customary permission and
                organise your transport and gear carefully.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The blue waterhole of <b>Aben d'Anawa</b> is located in the centre of the
                island, this is a cenote where rainwater collects and then forms two
                layers, fresh water and salt water. Anawa is the narrowest part of the
                isthmus. It marks the boundary between the districts of Fayaoué and
                Wénéki. The waterhole is home to a submerged forest at about 40 meters
                below the surface, at this point the underwater cave is 100 meters long
                and 60 meters wide. Another forest, this time of stalagmites and
                stalactites, proves that the island recently submerged and that the
                concretions and trees were able to develop in the open air before being
                drowned. Some of these holes are used as natural swimming pools by the
                children of the island, others shelter turtles.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The <b>Lékine cliffs</b> are situated 6 km south of Fayaoué.
                These high, grey, cliffs are riddled with caves facing the bay.
                Along the beach to the east, a pathway leads to the beginning of the swamp, between the stretch
                of sand and the cliffs.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The <b>Cong-Ouloup cave</b> can only be visited with the permission of the
                tribal chief, and also by undergoing the 'custom' rites. Legend has it
                that when the mainlanders invaded the island of Ouvea, the cave gave
                shelter to the gods of Canala. A track which leads to the top of the
                cliff offers a magnificent view.
            </p>


            <h3>Lifou</h3>

            <p>
                It is in Lifou that the largest number of caves have been found. Out of
                25 caves discovered, only 5 are open to tourists, and they can only be
                visited in the presence of a guide.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The <b>Quajo cave</b> in Qanono: to get there you have to walk through a forest.
                Coming out of the bushes in front of a greyish mass, you will find the
                entrance to the cave 20 meters further down. For those who want to go
                in, you will first have to swim along a dark corridor, carved out by the
                waters, before arriving in a natural swimming pool, surrounded by
                limestone terraces. This is where the dry cave begins. Watch out, you
                must follow the guide rope as you can easily get lost. Bring a
                waterproof torch so that you can admire the mineral sculptures found in
                each chamber. They are superb, some resemble beds of diamonds on the
                cave walls, others are called "the eccentrics" because of their strange
                crazy shapes, deifying gravity.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The <b>Luenghoni Cave</b> is only suitable for experienced cave divers. It is a
                flooded gallery more than 150 meters long and 30 meters deep. A true
                labyrinth, its many passages lead in all directions. You have to be
                careful following the guide rope. You plunge into the cold water then
                follow a lamp leading you to ever more beautiful chambers. The route
                leads past banyan tree roots falling into the water and stalactites
                reflected in limpid pools, you will also pass by fossilized shells. In
                the water are to be found eels and thermoclines, transparent fish with
                blind white eyes.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The <b>Devil’s Caves</b>, are 5 km from the aerodrome and the path to the caves
                is clearly marked. Once there, you have to contact the guide and
                remember to bring a torch. These caves abound with legends. The Qanopeu
                Cave (meaning "entrails of the earth where spirits are born"), includes
                three chambers. The second of these, about 40 meters long, is home to
                bats. The third is the Devil’s Bedroom with, at the back, a collapsed
                passage which used to lead to the sea.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The <b>Xodre cave</b> is between the cliffs and the sea, on the warrior route,
                is a cave you can visit.
            </p>


            <h3>Mare</h3>

            <p>
                The most elevated of the Loyalty Islands contains 14 caves including one
                of the largest underwater caves in the world.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The <b>Bone de la Léproserie</b> is a chasm which begins with a 50 metre well
                which, after climbing down a rope, ends up in a 40 metre deep lake. The
                entrance to this chasm only measures 25 meters in diameter, but the
                subterranean lake is 160 meters in diameter at its base. This is one of
                the largest flooded chambers, if not the largest, with 350,000 m3 of
                fresh water.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The <b>Bone Hole</b> or <b>Hole of the Lion</b> is a chasm 40 meters deep. The
                entrance is 45 meters in diameter. You can go to the edge of the
                circular cliff, in the middle of a tropical forest, and have a look down
                for hidden openings surrounding the dark-coloured lake. This 12 metre
                deep lake is unfortunately completely closed in and the gulf, at the
                bottom, reaches a diameter of 100 meters
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The <b>Pethoene cave</b> is near the Médu tribal village, 50 meters from the
                roadside, follow the little track leading through the forest to find the
                cave.
