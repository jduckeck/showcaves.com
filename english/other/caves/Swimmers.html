        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Is it just fiction or a real cave?
            The <b>Cave of Swimmers</b> is a central location in the movie <b>The English
            Patient</b>.
            A cave where prehistoric paintings show swimming people in the middle of the
            desert.
            This seems impossible, but there is an easy explanation: this area was not a
            desert some 10,000 years ago during the last cold period of the Ice Ages.
            To say it clear: the cave in the film is <b>not</b> the real cave, it is just a
            film set.
            The area around the cave is a location in Tunisia, near Degache.
            The cave interior was painted by an Italian woman painter.
            She painted the cave, and she is shown painting in the title sequence of the
            movie.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The real <b>Cave of Swimmers</b> lies in southwest Egypt, at the border to
            Lybia.
            It was explored by the real <b class="smallCaps">L&aacute;szl&oacute;
            Alm&aacute;sy</b> who wrote a book about his discoveries.
            He also wrote a whole chapter about his archaeological findings, which
            unfortunately was left out in several editions.
            He mentions the theory, that the motives of the drawings were real live
            scenes of daily life at this place.
            He explained this with a dramatic change in climate since then.
            This theory was so new, that his first editor added several footnotes, to make
            clear that he did not share this opinion.
            As far as I know, <b class="smallCaps">Alm&aacute;sy</b>'s book is only
            available in Hungarian and German (See the link below for the German book at
            Amazon).
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The discovery of the prehistoric rock painting sites in the Uweinat mountains,
            was the most important result of the 1933 <b
                class="smallCaps">Alm&aacute;sy</b> expedition.
            This expedition explored the <b>Uweinat</b> and <b>Gilf Kebir</b> region: <b>Ain
            Dua</b>, <b>Karkur Talh</b>, and <b>Wadi Sora</b>.
            Despite he was adviced and promised not to cross the border to Sudan, he did so
            and discovered several rock paintings in oases over there.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Gilf Kebir is a large mountain ridge, which extends over three countries, Egypt,
            Lybia and Sudan.
            The mountains consist of sandstones and crystalline rocks, like granite.
            Sandstone layers are porous which makes them good water reservoirs.
            They collect rain water and, at low points around the mountains, there are
            several springs which make small oases.
            Typically the rocks around the springs get eroded by the water, so each spring
            forms a sort of cliff or cavern.
            Most of the erosion happened long ago, when the area had much more rain and the
            production of the springs was much higher.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The caverns around the spring were used for shelter by stone age man, and of
            course they were important, maybe holy places.
            So they used paint to draw scenes of their daily live on the walls of the
            shelters.
            Flint stone tools can also be found, but as far as I know, no scientific
            excavation was made by now.
            This kind of caves was found all around Gilf Kebir, most of them at the south
            western corner in Lybia.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave of swimmers has a different geology.
            It is located in granite, so it is not the place of a spring.
            But it is located at the bottom of a wadi, a valley which once contained a
            river.
            So it is a cave formed by the flowing water at the undercut slope.
            It is easy to understand, why people would draw swimming people, while sitting
            at the banks of a river.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A last piece in the puzzle is the question how the paintings remained in the
            extreme climate of the desert.
            It seems, the natural pigments of the colours can resist temperatur changes very
            good.
            Paintings on certain rocks, where the surface is eroded by temperature changes,
            are lost forever.
            But granite is rather resistant.
            And the last problem is light, especially ultraviolett light, which destroys
            many colours (bleaching).
            <b class="smallCaps">Alm&aacute;sy</b> describes the absence of pintings in the
            part of the cave, which is reached by sunlight.
            It seems that direct sunlight destroyed the paintings at this place.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            To make one point clear: it is not easy to visit the real cave of swimmers.
            The geographic and political difficulties make it difficult for the regular
            tourist.
            But some tour operators from Egypt organize desert expeditions which include a
            visit of the cave.
            You should organize and book such a tour in advance, as you will not find it on
            the regular day trip schedule in your Hotel...
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            During the last years the cave has suffered various damages.
            Because of the movie several hundred people visit the cave every year.
            Unfortunately they leave garbage and destroy the surrounding area and the cave
            itself.
            Actually the awareness to protect the cave is not very high among the local
            guides.
            During the last years tons of garbage were removed from the area in a yearly
            cleanup.
            The country now started a project [2008] to protect the place by educating the
            guides and explaining the necessity to protect the area.
            Actually the guides should have an urge to protect it as it is the base of their
            income.
            The project now had a first success when the last cleanup produced only a fifth
            of garbage compared to previous years.
        </p>
