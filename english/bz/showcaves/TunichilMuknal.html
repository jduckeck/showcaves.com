        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Actun Tunichil Muknal</b> (ATM) is an important archaeological site, the cave was known to the ancient inhabitants of the area, the Mayas, and used for religious purposes.
            The name of the cave is translated as <b>Cave of the Crystal Sepulchre</b>, the name <b>Cave of the Crystal Maiden</b> is also commonly used.
            A small chamber called <b>stone sepulchre</b> contains a complete human skeleton covered by calcite crystals, the <b>Crystal Maiden</b>, hence the name.
            Of course, this is only the most spectacular Mayan remains among hundreds of ceramics, stoneware items, and bones of many persons which can be seen on the tour.
            The crystal "maiden" is actually a teenage boy, about 17 years old, who was probably a sacrifice victim.
            Due to his small size and slight frame it was initially believed to be a female.
            As a result some tour guides now call it <i>The Crystal Prince</i>, while others still call it <i>The Crystal Maiden</i>, including the Belize Tourism Board.
            And there are several such calcified skeletons in the <b>Main Chamber</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is sometimes called <b>Xibalba</b> (place of fright), but that’s actually not a name of a cave, it is the name for the afterlife, heaven or hell, the place where dead people go.
            The Maya believed that the underworld was in the underworld of the caves, and it was ruled by the Maya death gods and their helpers.
            Xibalba is described in the <b>Popol Vuh</b> (Book of the Community, Book of Counsel) as a court below the surface of the Earth.
            The <b>Popol Vuh</b> is an oral tradition, which was recorded in writing around 1550.
            The archaeological remains here are an obvious sign that this cave was seen as one of the entrances to the underworld, or a "gate to hell".
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is visited on a (mostly easy) cave trekking tour, but it requires some physical fitness and surefootedness, and the ability to swim.
            On the other side, it is not really difficult, just a lot of walking, wading in the cave river, and some swimming.
            Getting to the cave requires a 45-minute hike through the <b>Tapir Mountain Reserve</b>, through the jungle and crossing the river twice.
            Then a short swim into the cave through a crystal-clear stream flowing from the cave opening.
            Bring clothes to change, a towel and a plastic bag for the wet clothes.
            Also, enough water for half a day and a snack, probably some energy bars.
            Sturdy closed toe shoes, trekking shoes, or probably gum boots and comfortable clothes are essential.
            Also socks for entering the archaeological parts, where no shoes are allowed.
            Professional cave helmets, lights and waterproof bags are normally provided by the operators.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Inside the cave, the corridors are mostly flat, the passages are mostly spacious.
            There are no developed paths, the visitors follow the tracks of their predecessors.
            Although this is quite easy and not a problem for the visitors, it poses a danger to the cave and the archaeological remains.
            Visitors who wander around and accidentally step on fragile speleothems or archaeological remains pose a real danger.
            A few years ago, a visitor accidentally dropped his camera, which fell on a skull and smashed it.
            As a result, photography equipment was banned from being taken into the cave, including not only all types of cameras but also all types of smartphones.
            The result is a strange mixture of naïve recklessness and narrow-minded regulation that we both consider dangerous, to say the least.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is under protection because of its archaeological importance.
            After it was featured in National Geographic, it became a popular destination for adventurous travelers.
            In order to find a compromise between protection and tourist revenue, the Belize Tourism Board at first granted licences only to two tour operators.
            One of them is <b>Mayawalk Tours</b> in San Ignacio Cayo who offer guided tours to the cave.
            Beneath the so-called <b>Day Trips</b> they also offer <b>Overnight Camping Trips</b>, which include visits to various Mayan sites and rappelling into a sinkhole leading to ATM.
            They also offer tours into Barton Creek Cave and cave tubing trips.
            The other operator is <b>Pacz Tours</b>,
            However, things change, and today <b>Kawiil Tours</b> is the most prominent tour operator, who even provides the official link on Google.
            Their guide <b class="smallCaps">Luis</b> is very knowledgeable as he worked with the Belize Valley Archaeological Reconnaissance Project (BVAR).
            He obviously worked for the archaeologists Dr. <b class="smallCaps">Jamie Awe</b>, <b class="smallCaps">Sherry Gibbs</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Cameron Griffith</b>.
            And during this work he learned a lot about the archaeology of the cave firsthand.
            The cave is now located in the <b>Actun Tunichil Muknal Natural Monument</b>, which is managed by the <b>National Institute of Cultural and History</b> (NICH).
        </p>


        <div class="foreign">

            <p>
                Dr <b class="smallCaps">Jaime Awe</b>, from the University of New Hampshire, was the first archaeologist to explore Actun Tunichil Muknal (Cave of the Crystal Sepulchre).
                It was named after the sacrificial chamber within the cave where the remains of a young woman were found.
                Fourteen burials have been found in Actun Tunichil Muknal.
                The cave also contains two slate stelae in front of which Maya elites cut themselves with obsidian blades to collect their blood and offer it to the gods.
                A stream flows out of this cave, providing the main water supply for the camp.
                Actun Tunichil Muknal also contains large broken pottery.
                Calcite from dripwater has encased many of these finds over the centuries.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Numerous tourist outfits lead trips to the cave.
