        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The city of Josefov is located close to Jaroměř, but while Jaroměř is a real city, Josefov is different and somewhat artificial.
            It is actually not a city at all, it is a military fortification.
            The google earth view makes this absolutely clear.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            It was built between 1780 and 1787 under the auspices of <b class="smallCaps">Josef II</b>, the emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
            Josefov was originally named Josefstadt after him.
            The reason for its construction was the threat of Prussia from the north.
            Fortresses of this type were common at this time, and played an important role in the military strategies.
            Josefov was designed by the French general <b class="smallCaps">Duhamel de Querlonde</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Completed after only seven years, the fortress soon became one of the most important fortresses in the Empire.
            Up to 12,000 soldiers could be accommodated.
            But the theories were obviously wrong, neither during the Napoleonic wars nor during the Prussian-Austrian war in 1866 the fortress was of any use.
            Prussian troops simply bypassed the fortress at a safe distance, as they did not intend to get delayed.
            As a result the military strategy was changed and the town lost its status as a fortress in 1888.
            It was still used as barracks and during both world wars it was used for military purposes.
            During World War I it was a POW camp, with tens of thousands prisoners from Russia, Ukrainia, Serbia, Italia, and other nationalities.
            During World War II German Troops were stationed here.
            During the Soviet Invasion in 1968 it was confiscated by the Red Army, who used it until they left in 1991.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Today the city is renovated and used as a normal town.
            It was declared a historic preservation site in 1971.
            There are only a minute number of military personnel left.
            But the defense system of the old fortress is almost unchanged.
            There are bastions and ditches, and the underground defense system.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Underground Defense System was the central design rule of the fortress.
            The huge maze of underground corridors was originally about 45 km long.
            They are actually not underground, the corridors were built during the construction of the fortress.
            Coverd by enormous amounts of rocks it actually feels underground, and the thick walls offer a certain amount of protection against artillery fire from the enemy.
            These corridors were probably the largest underground means of defense in Europe during the 19th century.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            About 1 km of the old passages are shown to the public on guided tours.
            Participants get candle lanterns, which are the only source of illumination.
            The idea is, to give a realistic impression how the corridors were actually used.
            A part of the underground area is furnished with original military equipment.
            The guide explains the methods of underground combat.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In the main square of nearby Jaromer is a column monument dedicated to the Virgin Mary.
            Several statues of saints, which were created by the famous baroque sculptor <b class="smallCaps">Mathias Bernard Braun</b>, were removed from the monument and are now stored in the underground passages.
        </p>
