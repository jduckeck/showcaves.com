        <h2>History</h2>


        <br class="clear">


        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The former Capuchin monastery at the Kapuc&#237;nsk&#233;
            n&#225;m&#283;st&#237;, just south of the central market place, has a Baroque
            church, the church of the Holy Cross Finding.
            Its façade and a terrace with Baroque sculptures by <b
                class="smallCaps">Jan Adam Nessman</b> from 1765 is worth the visit, but the
            main sight is inside.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The architect <b class="smallCaps">M. Grimm</b> built a crypt below the church,
            which was used by the Capuchin monks to bury Capuchin order members, supporters
            and other personalities.
            People were buried here until 1780.
            The most famous members of this party are the counts of <b
                class="smallCaps">Sinzendorf</b>, owners of the Vever&iacute; Castle and Baron
            <b class="smallCaps">Trenck</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Kapuc&iacute;nsk&aacute; krypta</b> (Capuchin Crypt) was open for the
            public for a long time, actually it is part of a church.
            However, it is visited in combination with an permanent exhibition close to
            chapel.
            The special feature of the crypt was the climate, which caused the bodies of the
            dead to mumify.
            This is mainly a result of the effective ventilation system, the architect
            created for this vault.
            Mainly used by the monks for their own dead, it finally became popular among the
            local high society to be buried here.
            Finally the room was full and no more people were buried here.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b class="smallCaps">Franz Freiherr von der Trenck</b> (01-JAN-1711 Reggio,
            Italy, to 14-OCT-1749 Brno) was a legendary commander of the <b>pandur
            regiment</b> and is considered to be the father of military music.
            His military carreer was pretty stormy.
            He entered the Imperial army in 1728, in the age of 17, but resigned in disgrace
            three years later as a result of his combativeness.
            Soon after he entered a Russian Husar regiment, but was formally charged with
            misconduct and convicted to several months of forced labor in Kiew fortress.
            After his release he went to Po&#382;ega, Slavonia, to live there with his wife
            and family.
            After his wife died from the black plague, he tried to revive his military
            career and asked Empress <b class="smallCaps">Maria Theresia</b> for permission
            to raise an irregular corps of pandurs.
            His offer was refused, so he entered the Russian army as a mercenary.
            Soon he was accused of bad conduct, brutality and disobedience and condemned to
            death, but his sentence was commuted by Field Marschal <b
                class="smallCaps">Münnich</b> to degradation and imprisonment.
            Back in Austria he soon again came into conflict with everyone.
            The situation changed when Prince <b class="smallCaps">Charles Alexander of
            Lorraine</b> heard about his strange behavious and obtained an amnesty for him.
            He was commissioned in a corps of irregulars, where his personal bravery and his
            valuable services outweighed his bad manners.
            He finally earned most of his fame during the <b>War of the Austrian
            Succession</b>, as the leader and commander of the <b>Pandur</b>.
            But again their victories were counterbalanced by the atrocities they committed
            on the civilian population.
            But finally the number of serious military and moral offences became so big,
            that he was sentenced to death on a court-martial.
            The Empress commuted his sentence into imprisonment in fortress &#352;pilberk in
            Brno.
            After he had died he was buried in the Capuchin krypt following his last will.
            Today his mummified body is on display in a glass coffin.
