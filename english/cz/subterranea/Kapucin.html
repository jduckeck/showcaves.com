        <h2>History</h2>


        <br class="clear">


        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The former Capuchin monastery at the Kapucínské náměstí, just south of the central market place, has a Baroque church, the church of the Holy Cross Finding.
            Its façade and a terrace with Baroque sculptures by <b class="smallCaps">Jan Adam Nessman</b> from 1765 is worth the visit, but the main sight is inside.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The architect <b class="smallCaps">M. Grimm</b> built a crypt below the church, which was used by the Capuchin monks to bury Capuchin order members, supporters and other personalities.
            People were buried here until 1780.
            The most famous members of this party are the counts of <b class="smallCaps">Sinzendorf</b>, owners of the Veverí Castle and Baron <b class="smallCaps">Trenck</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Kapucínská krypta</b> (Capuchin Crypt) was open for the public for a long time, actually it is part of a church.
            However, it is visited in combination with an permanent exhibition close to chapel.
            The special feature of the crypt was the climate, which caused the bodies of the dead to mumify.
            This is mainly a result of the effective ventilation system, the architect created for this vault.
            Mainly used by the monks for their own dead, it finally became popular among the local high society to be buried here.
            Finally the room was full and no more people were buried here.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b class="smallCaps">Franz Freiherr von der Trenck</b> (01-JAN-1711 Reggio, Italy, to 14-OCT-1749 Brno) was a legendary commander of the <b>pandur regiment</b> and is considered to be the father of military music.
            His military career was pretty stormy.
            He entered the Imperial army in 1728, in the age of 17, but resigned in disgrace three years later as a result of his combativeness.
            Soon after he entered a Russian Husar regiment, but was formally charged with misconduct and convicted to several months of forced labor in Kiew fortress.
            After his release he went to Požega, Slavonia, to live there with his wife and family.
            After his wife died from the black plague, he tried to revive his military career and asked Empress <b class="smallCaps">Maria Theresia</b> for permission to raise an irregular corps of pandurs.
            His offer was refused, so he entered the Russian army as a mercenary.
            Soon he was accused of bad conduct, brutality and disobedience and condemned to death, but his sentence was commuted by Field Marschal <b class="smallCaps">Münnich</b> to degradation and imprisonment.
            Back in Austria he soon again came into conflict with everyone.
            The situation changed when Prince <b class="smallCaps">Charles Alexander of Lorraine</b> heard about his strange behavious and obtained an amnesty for him.
            He was commissioned in a corps of irregulars, where his personal bravery and his valuable services outweighed his bad manners.
            He finally earned most of his fame during the <b>War of the Austrian Succession</b>, as the leader and commander of the <b>Pandur</b>.
            But again their victories were counterbalanced by the atrocities they committed on the civilian population.
            But finally the number of serious military and moral offences became so big, that he was sentenced to death on a court-martial.
            The Empress commuted his sentence into imprisonment in fortress Špilberk in Brno.
            After he had died he was buried in the Capuchin krypt following his last will.
            Today his mummified body is on display in a glass coffin.
