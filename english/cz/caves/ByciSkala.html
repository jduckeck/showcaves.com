        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The <b>Býčí skála</b> (Bull Rock cave) is famous for archaeological remains found here.
            As early as 1872 a Hallstadt (Iron Age) grave was excavated in the entrance chamber of the cave by <b class="smallCaps">Jindřich Wankel</b>.
            The grave contained animal and material offerings, crops, textiles, ceramic and sheet-metal vessels, jewellery, glass and amber beads.
            Famous is the statuette of a bronze bull.
            This wealth is exhibited at the <b>Vienna Natural History Museum</b>.
            <b class="smallCaps">Jindřich Wankel</b> is also called the <i>father of Moravian archaeology</i>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Astonishing is the fact, that the remains of one man and 40 young women were found.
            As the grave was very well equipped, it was interpreted as the grave of a nobleman, with young women which were ritually killed to accompany him.
            This rather romantic interpretation, and several others were disproved at the end of the twentieth century.
            However, the fame and the importance of the location remains.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave contains a Neolithic picture, which is considered the oldest cave painting in the Czech Republic.
            It depicts a geometrical shape resembling a grill with a size of 30x40 cm, painted by coal on the cave wall.
            The carbon was dated with the C14 radio-carbon method to be 5,200 years old.
            The pattern resembles decorations on some ceramic vessels from that period.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            During the 20th century the cave was used for military purposes.
            This seems to have ended with the recent Glasnost movement.
            The natural entrance is very low, but an artificial tunnel allows access to the entrance chamber.
            As the archaeological remains are removed, this room is rather unimpressive.
            Behind this room is a nice cave with speleothems, but access is possible only for speleologists.
            Beneath its scientific value, this cave is of no touristic interest and not open to the public.
            But it is possible to visit the cave entrance with its wide and low portal and a shallow side cave.
            The place is very nice for a picnic.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In [2007] we were informed that the cave is now open on special occasions.
            The dates are published on the official website of the cave, see the link below.
            In 2023, this were three weekends in June.
            This is unfortunately quite impractical for foreign visitors.
            We guess it is intended for locals only.
        </p>


        <!--

        The Bull Rock cave is located in the Moravian Karst about 15
        km (10 miles) northeast of Brno, Moravian biggest town. The
        place is well-known throughout Europe due to a unique
        archaeological find which was discovered here by "father of
        Moravian archaeology" Mudr. Jindřich Wankel in 1872. His find
        dates from the Hallstatt Iron Age, i.e. from the turn of the
        6th-5th century B.C. Under layers of sand, gravel, limestone
        boulders and white matter he found two large hearths. There was
        plenty of iron, bronze, gold and pottery objects, amber and
        glass jewels scattered around. Some of them are so unique and
        priceless that they are incomparable to other finds in Europe
        from that period. It is, first of all, a statue of bronze bull
        with iron triangular inlays, a bronze helmet and sceptre with a
        set of a hanging objects. ring-shaped chest armour, arrows and
        axes were also discovered but on the whole there were few
        weapons found there. In the bigger hearth J.Wankel found parts
        of cart mounting, an erect wooden pole and remains of burnt
        human bones while at the edge of the hearths there were amber
        and glass beads, pieces of rolled-up material, burnt vegetable
        fibre- probably parts of baskets. Pottery was filled with burnt
        grains and other organic matter. On a simple stone altar at the
        big hearth there were two severed girls hands and half a human
        skull. Another skull was found in one of bronze bowl, one of
        which was filled with burnt grains, the other shaped into a cup.
        On the cave ground he found parts of human skeletons belonging
        to about 40 corpses, some of them missing heads and limbs.
        Wankel interpreted his marvellous discovery as the funeral of
        the powerful Hallstatt chieftain who was buried with many gifts
        and on his way to the other world was followed not only by
        animals but also by his wives and slaves. Wankel believed the
        funeral to be buried under limestone boulders and gravel at the
        end of event to prevent dishonour. Limestone boulders lying on
        the hearth should have been burnt into a layer of lime.
        Unfortunately, documentation on finds from the Býčí skála was
        only recorded informally in Wankels book "Bilder aus der
        Mahrischen Schweiz und ihrer Vergangenhait" Consequently various
        interpretations of the finds turned up at the end of the last
        century. Many archaeologists supported the idea that there was a
        group of refugees who after having hidden in the cave with their
        treasure were captured and beaten up. Another interpretation had
        it that foreign iron ore prospectors were beaten to death by
        local people. Despite all this, all archaeologists have agreed
        in recent years that the objects layout does not correspond to
        burial customs in the Hallstatt Age. Thus some years ago a new
        hypothesis was formed: that it was a disaster during which a
        hidden group of people caused the celling to cave in. The book,
        which you have in your hand, describes the Býčí skála cave and
        its surroundings in great detail. The Iron Age in Central Europe
        is briefly characterized here including the role of the famous
        town Hallstatt in the Austrian Alps. You will also read about
        the interesting life of J.Wankel. You will learn about the major
        finds and their layout. Step by step all hypotheses are
        critically evaluated and their weaknesses pointed out. The
        evaluation shows to what extent each hypothesis is credible.
        Even so, most facts support the interpretation of the Býčí skála
        cave as an important sacrificial site. This view is even shared
        by the author of this part of the book and is backed by new
        evidence here. Besides the objects and corpses found here, the
        erect wooden pole supports this hypothesis as well. The analysis
        of the geological situation and medieval records revealed a
        shaft leading to the cave - similar entrances are known from
        various cult places in Europe. petrographic analysis of "the
        burnt limestone" showed it to be a cave sediment, so called
        "sinter". All these finds including the location of the cave
        support the interpretation of the Býčí skála cave as an
        important cult site. The book is further suplemented by so far
        unpublished facts on the Nazis building activities during the
        years 1943-45. In that period the Býčí skála was to have been
        changed into an underground factory. The closing part of the
        book briefly summarizes speleological research and the
        activities of speleological groups working in this cave today
