            <b>Jeskyně na Turoldu</b> is the newest show cave of the Czech Republik, and was opened in 2004.
            The cave is located in the Jurassic limestones of the Palavske vrchy hills, and is part of the <b>Pálava UNESCO Biosphere Reserve</b>.
            As most caves in the Czech Republic, especially the big ones, have formed in Devonian limestones, the <b>Jeskyně Na Turoldu-Liščí díra</b> cave system is actually the longest cave in Jurassic limestones with a length of 3.1 km.
            The cave has seven levels.
            Speleological exploration in the Jeskyně Na Turoldu-Liščí díra system is still ongoing, and every year cavers increase the total length.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The landscape along the Austrian-Czech border is a fertile plain, a renowned wine-growing area.
            And right north of the border lies a sort of mountain called <b>Kocici skala</b> (Cat's mountain), limestone hills raising 530 m asl from the plain at about 200m asl.
            This area is called the <b>Jihomoravský Kras</b> (South Moravian Karst) and is 10 km long and 7 km wide.
            The karst has mostly Jurassic, but also some Cretaceous limestones.
            The hills belong to the <b>Západní Karpaty</b> (West Carpathian) Mountains, at least geologically, as the Carpathian Mountains actually begin at the Danube, about 80 km southeast.
            The southernmost hill is called Turold Hill (385 m asl) and contains the homonymous Jeskyně na Turoldu.
            The area is very rich in caves, the Turold Hill only has 18 caves which are known so far.
            The hill was quarried for the limestone which was used to build the houses of the village of Mikulov and around.
            During the quarrying, several caves were discovered, but later destroyed by the continuing quarrying.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The ticket office of Na Turoldu lies on the northern end of the village Mikulov, close to the Amfiteátr (open air theatre) and the police station.
            It was built at the entrance to the abandoned quarry.
            A short walk leads to the far end of the quarry, where the quarry floor was used to create a sort of geologic trail or rock exhibition.
            All kinds of rocks from the area were placed here, including crystalline rocks and basaltic columns.
            This is a good place to spend the waiting time for the next tour.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is entered through a steel door, and soon the typical character of the cave becomes obvious: it is very dry, almost dusty, and it is a series of steep clefts and stairs.
            The cave formed obviously by a combination of tectonic forces and solution.
            There was never a cave river, there are no stalactites or stalagmites.
            But the cave was once filled with carbonate rich water for a very long time, and so huge layers of calcite crystals formed.
            Walls are covered by crystals, by bulbous calcite and sometimes by moonmilk.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The first chamber is named <b>Old Hall</b>, and is the section which was first discovered.
            A huge rock is called <b>Guard</b>, unfortunately it did not guard very well, and the speleothems of this section were broken off and removed by the quarry workers and early visitors.
            From here the trail goes in circles continually down, the cave does not have shafts, but it is a three-dimensional labyrinth and its vertical extension is bigger thanb the horizontal.
            The next chamber was named <b>Balvanitého dómu</b> (Boulder Dome) after huge blocks broken away from the ceiling.
            A wooden staircase leads down to the <b>Klenotnice</b> (Treasury), with snowy walls corroded into extraordinarily rugged spaces and small cavities.
            The lustrous crystals of pure calcite were named <b>turoldská výzdoba</b> (Turold decoration), because they can be found in no other cave in the Czech Republic.
            The <b>Shark Jaws Hall</b> was named after a formation which actually resembles shark teeth.
            Another descent leads to the <b>Netopýřího dómu</b> (Bat Dome).
            The snowy-white ceilings are covered with brownish stains caused by iron oxides and with small black dots caused by manganese oxides.
            Finally, the <b>Síně konce</b> (End Hall) is reached, which contains a small exhibition of bones of mammoth, buffalo, prehistoric horse and bear.
            They were found during quarrying, in caves which have been destroyed in the process.
            There is also an exhibition of Mesozoic fossils of bivalves and gastropods from the Pálava Hills.
            A side branch leads from the Bat Dome to the <b>Pohádkové síně</b> (Fairytale Hall).
            The weathered dolomite has bizarre shapes, the floor is covered by white limestone sand, which is rare in caves.
            Now the tour returns to the surface on the same way.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The water level is the karst water level, which is connected to the surrounding plains.
            It seems it was much lower when the cave was first developed as a show cave, as the lowest part of the tour is not guided any more.
            The risen water level is only one reason for this, the other reason is a lake of carbon dioxide.
            This gas is heavier than the normal air and collects at the bottom of the cave.
            Unfortunately, the gas, while not really dangerous or poisonous itself, does not contain any oxygen, so people entering the carbon dioxide lake soon suffocate while still breathing.
            The carbon dioxide is produced deep below the cave, and rises through the fissures in the rock.

            This is one of the caves which were not created by surface carbon dioxide, but by carbon dioxide from below.
            This type of caves is called

            They are actually not uncommon, but they are not as common as normal caves.
            And the scientific process of analyzing this process was rather slow, they were not recognized by most speleologists.
            This changed with <b class="smallCaps">Alexander B. Klimchouk</b>, a famous geologist and speleologist who worked at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.
            He did years of research and wrote a lot of publications, and our knowledge about this process today was mostly explored by him.
            Unfortunately, he deceased a few years ago.
            The hypogene cave formation is one sort of corrosion and beneath erosion responsible for a certain amount of cave formation in most caves.
            However, some caves like this one were formed almost entirely by hypogene processes.

            This cave is the largest known bat hibernation site in the territory of the reserve.
            It is the largest hibernation site for the endangered Lesser Horseshoe Bat (<i>Rhinolophus hipposideros</i>) in South Moravia.
            Bats have been monitored since 1958, the total number of species found in the cave is 15.
            Even during summer, about 250 bats can be seen on the tour in the Bat Hall.
