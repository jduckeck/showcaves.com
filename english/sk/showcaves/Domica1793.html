from:
<b class="smallCaps">Robert Townson</b> (1793):
    <b>Travels in Hungary</b>.

<em>
He was a Scottish botanist who visited this cave during a visit to the old
kingdom of Hungary.
Today he would be justly criticised for not have three forms of lighting
and for vandalising speleothems.

I descended rapidly for a short distance and then I found myself in an
immense, dark, damp, cave where large stalactites, as thick as my body,
hung pendant from the roof, and I was shown others where the sides were
ornamented in the manner of the most curious Gothic workmanship.  In some
the stalactites were so thick and close together that we were in danger
of losing one another if we separated but a few yards.  Here aged
stalactites, overloaded with their own weight, had fallen down and lay
prostrate and there an embryo stalactite was just blooming into
existence.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
After I had wandered about three or four hours in this awful gloom and
had reached the end of the caverns in one direction, I thought it time to
come out, and I desired my guide to return.  After we started back, as we
thought, some way, we found no passage further, yet the guide was sure he
was right. I thought I recognised the same rocks we had just left, and
which had prevented our proceeding further, but the guide was positive he
was in the right direction.  Luckily for us I had written my name on the
soft clay of the bottom of the cave, which had been the extent of our
journey.  On seeing this the guide was thunderstruck, and ran this way
and that way and knew not where he was, nor what to do.  I desired him
not to be frightened, but to go calmly to work to extricate us from this
labyrinth.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
After wandering about till our fackels were nearly exhausted, we found a
great stalactite from which, on account of its remarkable whiteness, I
had been induced to knock off a specimen as I came by.  I recollected how
I stood when I struck it.  This at once set us right, and after walking a
little further we made ourselves heard to the other guide, from whom we
got fresh torches, and we continued our route homeward without further
difficulty.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
So complete a labyrinth as these caverns are in some places, is not I am
sure to be found in similar caverns, large open passages proved to be cul
de sacs, whilst our road was over and under, through and amongst grotto
work of the most intricate nature.  I finally believe that even if a man
should have lights and food enough to last him a month - he would not be
able to find his way out.
