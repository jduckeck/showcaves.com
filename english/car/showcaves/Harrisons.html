        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Harrison's Cave</b> is said to be the most popular tourist attraction in
            Barbados.
            Many tour operators offer trips to this cave, and so it is easy to book such a
            trip from your hotel.
            The cave is located in the hillcountry in the center of the island.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave visit starts at a new park where a new exhibit was created.
            Next stop is the <b>Visitor Reception Centre</b> (VRC), where visitors buy the
            tickets.
            It is located at the cliff top, overlooking the valley, the cave tour starts at
            the valley floor.
            There are three glass-fronted elevators which offer a breathtaking view while
            descending.
            However, we recommend to walk down on one of the two scenic trails, if time
            permits.
            At the valley floor lies the <b>Cave Interpretative Centre</b> (CIC), which is
            the original cave entrance building which was renovated between 2006 and 2010.
            This is a good place to spend the time until the tour starts.
            There are numerous exhibits and interactive displays on the cave, its discovery
            and exploration.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tour starts with a nine minute introductory video in the multimedia room.
            The cave is visited using a so-called electric tram, an engine which pulls
            several trailers, which are wide enough to seat five persons in a row.
            It stops at two points and the passengers are allowed to disembark and have a
            closer look.
            This cave visit is very comfortable but also has some drawbacks.
            Although photography is allowed or even supported, which is laudably, it is
            difficult from a moving tram.
            It is also hard to have a closer look at the features, as the tram moves on.
            And finally, the development works which were necessary to allow the use of this
            tram were substantial, and affected the cave essentially.
            It is a sort of paved single lane road which was built through the cave, with
            some massive tunneling work in the narrower passages.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A visit to Harrison's Cave is definitely worthwhile.
            The cave shows numerous speleothems, common dripstones but also pools, dogtooth
            spars and more.
            Some of the formations are yellow or beige, but most of them show a beautiful
            bright white.
            The cave is very well lit, which brings out the character of the cave.
            The cave branches out immediately after the entrance.
            Both the two main passages are toured, and as both are dead ends, it is
            necessary to turn around and go back the same way.
            Not really a drawback, as it gives the visitors the chance to see the cave from
            the <i>"other side"</i>, which often looks different.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The passages are rather big, halls are often 20m high.
            One sight is a green lake, which provides a connection to a natural entrance.
            This is the place where the cave was originally discovered.
            The modern entrance is an artificial tunnel.
            Another sight is a 14m high waterfall at the end of the second branch.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Harrison's Cave</b> and nearby Harrison College were both named after <b
                class="smallCaps">Thomas Harrison</b>.
            But while he established the school in 1733 which later became Harrison College,
            it is unclear if he ever visited the cave.
            He simply owned the land and the cave on it, so it was named after him.
            During the 18th and 19th century several expeditions tried to explore the cave,
            but the cave was technically challenging and they did not get very far.
            Actually the cave was more or less unexplored until 1970.
            At this time <b class="smallCaps">Ole Sorensen</b>, an engineer from Denmark,
            and <b class="smallCaps">Anthony Mason</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Allison
            Thornhill</b>, two young men from Barbados, heard of the cave and explored and
            surveyed it.
            The development of the cave by the Barbados government started in 1974.
            Shafts and tunnels were excavated, and the cave was equipped with a tram.
            It was opened to the public in 1981.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Harrison's Cave was maintained and developed for years by the
            <b class="smallCaps">Gurnee</b>s, a couple with many merits in caving.
            They are famous for their book about show caves in the USA (<b>Gurnee Guide to
            American Caves</b>) and they worked on many karst areas on Carribbean Islands
            and in Middle America.
            <b class="smallCaps">Russel Gurnee</b> was president of the National
            Speleological Society (NSS) 1961 to 1963, <b class="smallCaps">Jeanne</b> 1992
            to 1994.
            <b class="smallCaps">Jeanne Gurnee</b> is a member of the <b>Society of Woman
            Geographers</b> (SWG) since 1967 and was honored with SWG's <b>Outstanding
            Achievement Award</b> in 1987.
            Today the cave is maintained by the <b>Barbados National Trust</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In July 2006 the cave was closed for redevelopment work.
            The project was planned to take 15 months and cost BBD 34 million.
            <!--
            Date July 09, 2006 Compliments of the Nation News by DONNA SEALY
            CHINA STATE CORPORATION will be undertaking the redevelopment work at Harrison's
            Cave.CHINA STATE CORPORATION will be undertaking the redevelopment work at
            Harrison's Cave.
            Minister of the Environment, Elizabeth Thompson, announced on Friday that the
            15-month project will cost $34 million. Work is set to begin on July 15.
            After thousands of tours and rave reviews over the last 25 years, the cave,
            located in Allen View, St Thomas, was closed to the public on Friday.
            The minister said it was not an end but "a transition intended to give the cave
            a new lease on life as Barbados' premier natural attraction and to reinforce
            this designation
            -->
            Obviously this plan was not met, as the cave was finally reopened in 2010, after
            four years and four months closure.
            And after it cost a total of BBD 84 million.
            The explosion of costs, which was offically explained by the introduction of
            "ecologic" improvements, was critizized by numerous locals.
            It also caused an enormous raise of the entrance fees, which were doubled.
            Actually the new entrance fees were published almost half an year before the
            cave was reopened.
            Obviously it will take some time until this investment will repay, even with the
            new fees.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The renovation works included the installation of state-of-the-art trams,
            including one for wheelchair-bound visitors.
            The trams are powered by batteries which are now recharged using solar power.
            Other ecologic improvements were the installation of a water treatment plant and
            the usage of rain and grey water for irrigation.
            A new car park with 114 parking spaces was created, a new visitor center solely
            for the selling of tickets and elevators to the old visitor center, which has
            now an improved exhibition on the cave.
