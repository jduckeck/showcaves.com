            New Zealand is situated in the South Pacific Ocean, 1,600km south-east of
            Australia.
            It consists of two big islands, the <b>North Island</b> and the <b>South
            Island</b> and an amount of smaller islands.
            New Zealand has caves on both large islands.
            Some of them are show caves.

            The life on this islands is really special: many endemic species, especially
            flightless birds, like the <b>Kea</b>, the <b>Kiwi</b>, the <b>Kakapo</b> or the
            <b>Weka</b>.
            There are strange plants, like the fern trees.
            And of course, there is special life inside the caves: the <b>glow worms</b> are
            bioluminescent larvae of an endemic fly.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            All this strange things are a result of New Zealands extraordinary geology.
            200 Million years ago only one single continent existed, called
            <b>Gondwanaland</b>.
            This super-continent broke up into pieces, two of the pieces were Australia and
            New Zealand.
            Since this time the life on Australia and New Zealand was separated from the
            rest of the world.

            New Zealand is located on the rim between two tectonic plates, the Pacific plate
            and the Australian plate.
            The location at the plate rim results in volcanism all around the islands,
            especially on the North Island.
            New Zealand is part of the <b>fire belt</b> around the Pacific Ocean.
            Volcanoes erupt now and then, most famous is a young island which formed at the
            coast of New Zealand some decades ago.
            The more moderate volcanism produces heat energy and electricity in numerous
            hydrothermal power plants on the North Island.
            And some of this volcanic places are famous tourist destinations, like Waiotapu Geothermal Area, Rotorua, on
            North Island.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The extremely efficient use of volcanic energy on North Island, and the enormous
            amount of water power on South Islands is big enough to provide all needed
            electricity.
            New Zealand does not import fossil energy to produce electricity, they only use
            renewable sources.
            Of course they are not autarc, as they need petrol for their cars and for
            heating.
        </p>

        <table class="rightImg">
            <tr>
                <td><a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../images/Big/070-973.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../images/070-973.jpg" width="250" height="188"></a></td>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Beneath volcanism there are numerous other processes connected with the location
            of the islands at active plate rims.
            Although the plates do not really collide, the forces have an narrowing
            component which was the force which built the Southern Alps.
            The Australian plate is more rigid and it moves norteast, the Pacific plate
            moves southwest.
            The rim runs nearly north-south, more or less parallel to the west coast of
            South Island.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            So the two forces do not meet frontal, but somewhat diagonal, which splits the
            force into two components.
            The frontal component works rectangular to the plate rim, compresses the rocks,
            bends them upwards and produces thus a continual uplift which formed the Alps.
            The lateral component makes the two plates move along each other, which is
            called <b>strike-slip</b>.
            This lateral movement produces earthqakes from time to time.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Tectonic forces, volcanic rocks and schists and crystalline rocks uplifted by the
            orogeny, there are also many sedimentary rocks.
            Among those rocks are numerous limestones and marbles which are karstified.
            Because of the complicated geology of New Zealand, they form small patches, all
            over the islands.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The most important karst region is around <b>Waitomo</b>, on North Island.
            Here are most of the caves and other karst features, which can be visited on
            walks.
            On South Island is an important karst area west of <b>Nelson</b> on the northern
            coast, with two show caves and the biggest karst spring of the southern
            hemisphere.
            Another karst area is located at the west coast around the famous tourist
            destination <b>Pancake Rocks</b>, which are formed of limestone.
            This area has has no show caves but several tour operators guide tourists into
            wild caves open to the public.
