<p>
The Waitomo Glowworm Cave system has two levels, the low one is the bed of the
<b>Waitomo River</b>, the upper one is dry.
There is a connection between both levels, the 16 meters deep shaft called the
<b>Tomo</b>.
Visitors enter the cave at the top level and walk down narrow passageways to the
low level.
The room called the <b>Banquet Chamber</b> is the place where early tourists
stopped for meal.
Then the path leads further down to the low level with the cave river, along
numerous interesting formations.

<p class="indentedText">
The largest chamber of the cave is the <b>Cathedral</b>, with a demonstration
platform and the jetty.
The acoustics in this chamber are world-renowned, <b class="smallCaps">Kiri Te
Kanawa</b>, the famous New Zealand singer, has sung here and was delighted by
the purity of the sound.
This large chamber is used as a concert hall now and then.
But still the visitors are now told to be as quiet as possible, because sound
would disturb the glowworms.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The trip finishes with a boat ride through the Cathedral, small boats gently
slide into the black darkness.
The reason is the main sight of this cave, which gave this chamber the name
<b>Waitomo Glowworm Grotto</b>.
As the eyes adjust to the dark, the walls and roof start to sparkle like a star
filled night sky.
This tiny lights are produced by <b>glowworm larvae</b> (<i>Arachnocampa
luminosa</i>).
The larvae build webs along the cave walls, similar to spider webs, and try to
attract their victims by the light.
After eating and growing the larvae pupate and become two-winged flies, which
live only a few days for reproduction.
They do not have a digestive system.
However, most of them become attracted by one of the lights and end in the web
of a next generation larva.
The glowworms are found all over New Zealand, also on Tasmania and Australia, 
but nowhere else on Earth.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The cave had its darkest days during the year 1979, when the population of 
glowworms dropped by 96%, and the famous night sky became dark.
This was the first time, the management discovered that it could be necessary to
protect the cave in order to protect the business.
As a matter of fact New Zealand does not have a legislation protecting caves by
now.
In 1980 a scientific research program monitoring the cave climate started and a 
scientific advisory committee was founded.
As a result the cave is very good monitored concerning humidity, temperature and
CO<sub>2</sub> content in the air.
The air climate is controlled by opening and closing the airtight entrance door
of the dry upper entrance in dependency on hourly measures of climatic parameters
inside and outside the cave.
A rule was installed to keep CO<sub>2</sub> content below 2,400ppm, if it
reaches this border the cave is closed completely.
Actually the CO<sub>2</sub> rises in times of high visitation during the warm
summer season in February.
So if you are not from abroad, we suggest to visit at other times of the year.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The entrance to the cave is 500 meters beyond the Museum of Caves.
The cave is easily accessible to those with reasonable mobility, with good
handrails and paths.
The boat ride at the end of the tour ends outside the cave at the spring of the
cave river.
Independent travellers should try to avoid visiting during the middle of the day
when the cave is very busy with tour groups.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The Visitor Centre of the caves was destroyed in a fire in 2005, right after the
exhibition had been updated.
The construction of the new Waitomo Glowworm Caves Visitor Centre took five
years, the new centre was inaugurated on 22-OCT-2010.
It took some time, but there was a lot of planning involved, and the result is
spectacular.
The building was designed after the minimal environmental intervention
principle, the building follows the contours of the land and the curve of the
Waitomo stream.
A grid shell structure built of New Zealand Radiata pine is covered with
transparent cladding.
Right before the inauguration the building has already won awards, Commercial
Architectural Excellence, Commercial Engineering Excellence, and the Clever Wood
Solution Award on the NZ Wood Timber Design Awards 2010.
