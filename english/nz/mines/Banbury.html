        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The tour into <b>Banbury Mine</b> near Denniston is called <b>Underground Union
            Express</b>.
            The theme of the trip is the work life of a miner.
            It starts with reporting in at the mine office and signing the Union Membership
            Card.
            The the work day as a miner begins, the visitors are kitted out with lamp, hard
            hat and protective gear.
            Everyone is assigned a work role and the new miners are travelling by train
            along the dramatic Waimangaroa Gorge to the mine.
            During the trip the miners are educated in the lost mining language of banjos,
            sprags and devils.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At the mine entrance the miners are tagging in, which means they take a
            <b>tag</b>, a small iron plate, with them.
            They have to retrurn it when they return to the surface, so when the tags are
            complete again, everybody is out of the mine.
            It case of an accident it possible to determine how many are still in the mine.
            Now the mine is entered on a 170 m long ride on a mine train.
            There are many interactive displays, so visitors who physically active can
            actually try any kind of typical work for themselfes.
            For example swinging banjos, clipping coal tubs and putting up pit props.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The whole tour lasts 105 minutes, its one hour outside the mine and 45 minutes
            underground.
            It starts and ends at the car park in Denniston.
            Visitors must be able to walk unassisted for 45 minutes and children under 5 are
            not allowed in the mine for security reasons.
            Visitors are provided with helmet, headlamp and a waterproof jacket.
            We recommend extra warm clothes comfortable for walking and Sturdy footwear.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Banbury Mine is a very new show mine.
            The whole concept is based on interaction and it is a sort of mining related
            theme park.
            The mine has been abandoned long ago, so all exhibits are actually new or
            relocated from other sites, including the mine train and all the machinery.
            The mine train and the train through the rain forest to the mine entrance were
            constructed by Stelvio Ltd in 2009 and 2010.
            In 2007 they reconstructed the nearby <b>Denniston Incline</b> which is also
            worth a visit when you are here.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Denniston Incline</b> is a site owned by the Historic Places Trust and
            the DOC.
            It was renovated in 2007 and the upper end is now again in a working state.
            An original brake drum is on display in the
            <a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../nz/mines/Coaltown.html"><img alt="Mine" class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Mine.png">Coaltown Museum</a>.
            A visit to the incline is a good completion to the mine tour.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This is a funicular or cable railway, a car running on tracks and held by a
            cable.
            The incline was 1.7 km long with a height difference of 510 m, some sections have
            gradients over 1:1.3.
            Actually there were two inclines, the upper part to the <b>Middle Brake</b> was
            steeper, then the wagon was disconnected from the rope of the first incline, and
            placed on the rope of the second incline.
            From here the descent to Conns Creek was more gentle.
            The waggons where accumulated at Conns Creek and then marshalled into trains and
            taken to the port of Westport for unloading into coal ships.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Funiculars have two balanced train cars, if both have the same weight the
            engines are simply there to overcome inertia and friction.
            If the upward is heavier, the transport energy has to be produced by the
            engines.
            If the lower bound is heavier, the problem is to get rid of the energy.
            The Denniston incline transported coal downwards, so there were huge brakes
            which used water to slow the pistons of the drums.
            There was only a single track, but in the middle was a passing loop, which
            allowed the empty and full wagon to pass.
            The up side of the loop was called the <b>Donkey Side</b>, the down side was
            called the <b>Company Side</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Actually such a system is pretty safe, because the rope, which connects the two
            wagons makes sure they always meet at the loop.
            In reality there were numerous near misses and head-ons, some of the destroyed
            wagons still lie at beside the incline.
            Numerous workers died and also some people traversing the incline route.
            We guess the head-ons were a result of the rope changing the length with
            temperature.
            If the temperature related expanding of the rope is not compensated, accidents
            can happen with very low and very high temperatures.
            A passing loop which is a little longer would actally do the same trick.
            So at the end the accidents were a result of greed, not the technology.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The village of <b>Denniston</b> existed solely for the mine workers.
            It grew after coal was discovered and the mining started, as a miner settlement.
            In the early 20th century it had about 1,500 inhabitants.
            And in the early years it was really isolated, because the incline was the only
            means of transportation.
            The road was built much later.
            With the end of the mining the number of jobs and thus the number of inhabitants
            rapidly shrank.
            Today there are only 50 inhabitants left, and the town resembles a ghost town.
        </p>
