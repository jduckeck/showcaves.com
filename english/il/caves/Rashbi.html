        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The word Rashbi is an acronym from the words <b>Ra</b>bbi <b
                class="smallCaps"><b>Sh</b>imon <b>b</b>ar <b>Y</b>ochai</b>.
            Rabbi <b class="smallCaps">Shimon bar Yochai</b> was one of the great
            <b>Tannaitic</b> sages who lived during the era of Roman persecution in the 2nd
            century.
            His story, which contains a cave in a prominent role, is well known to any
            Jewish child.
        </p>

        <div class="foreignText">

            <p>
                Rabbi <b class="smallCaps">Shimon</b>, well-versed in miracles, was sent to Rome
                to the emperor <b class="smallCaps">Antoninus Pius</b> by the leaders of the
                Jewish people.
                It was an attempt to have the ban on Jewish observance officially lifted.
                The daughter of the emperor was possessed by a demon, which Rabbi Shimon
                exorcised.
                Because of this the ban was abolished.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                But later - in the year 149 (3909) - Rabbi <b class="smallCaps">Shimon</b> had
                to flee from the Roman authorities.
                In a private discussion he argumented that the commercial and social benefits
                caused by the Romans in Israel were merely out of self-interest.
                This was betrayed to the Roman authorities, who sentenced Rabbi <b
                    class="smallCaps">Shimon</b> to death penalty.
                He and his son Rabbi <b class="smallCaps">Elazar</b> fled and hid in a cave.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                While they hid in the cave, a miracle happened.
                They were sustained by the fruit of a carob tree and water from a spring,
                created to allow them to live inside the cave.
                they did not leave the cave for 12 years, until the emperor died and their
                sentence was annulled.
                They did not leave the cave a single time in this 12 years but studied the Torah
                day and night.
                They were naked and covered themselves with the sand in the cave, to protect
                their clothes from wearing out.
                They only put them on for their daily prayers.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                At the time the sentence was annulled, <b class="smallCaps">Elijah</b> stood at
                the door of the cave and invited them to leave.
                But they were so totally immersed in the Torah, it was traumatic for them, and
                consequently for the entire world.
                Whatever they cast their eyes upon was immediately burnt up.
                After they turned a farmed on a field into dust by looking at him, a <b>Heavenly
                Echo</b> appeared and told them "Have you emerged to destroy My world? Return to
                your cave!"
                So they stayed another year in the cave until they were able to leave the cave
                without harm to others.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                During his stay in the cave, Rabbi <b class="smallCaps">Shimon</b> wrote the
                main body of the <b>Zohar</b>, called the <b>First Mishna</b>.
                He had various disciples, who were called <b>chevraya</b>.
                One of them, Rabbi <b class="smallCaps">Aba</b>, recorded most of his teachings,
                which he passed on orally to his close associates.
                Other important chevraya were Rabbi <b class="smallCaps">Yehuda</b>, Rabbi <b
                    class="smallCaps">Yossi ben Yaakov</b>, Rabbi <b class="smallCaps">Yitzchak</b>,
                Rabbi <b class="smallCaps">Chizkiya</b>, Rabbi <b class="smallCaps">Chiya</b>,
                Rabbi <b class="smallCaps">Yossi</b>, and Rabbi <b class="smallCaps">Yaakov bar Idi</b>.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Rewritten from
                Talmud Bavli, Shabbos 33b (reminiscent of the 33 of Lag B'Omer)
            </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            Rabbi <b class="smallCaps">Shimon</b> is probably the most important Rabbi in
            Jewish history, he is mentioned in every chapter of the Talmud.
            He is best known as the author of the Zohar, but he also holds an important
            place in the revealed aspects of Torah, the Talmud and associated works.
            He is also the author of all statements in the <b>Sifri</b> (a Midrash on
            Halacha) and the author of <b>Mechilta d'Rashbi</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is located at the western Galilee town of Pekiin, a small village which
            is home to mostly Druze, a minority of Greek Orthodox Arabs.
            The town is known in Arabic as <b>El Bukeia</b>, meaning <i>little valley</i>
            (bik'a).
            A spring in the town is used as drinking water supply for the town, and is said
            to be the remains of Rashbis cave spring.
            The cave is a few minutes uphill.
            At the entrance is an an ancient carob tree, perhaps the very one that sustained
            Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Elozor for thirteen years.
            The cave is quite small, but visitors are told that it stretched all the way to
            Meiron at the time of Rabbi Shimon.
            An earthquake destroyed it, so the story goes.
        </p>
