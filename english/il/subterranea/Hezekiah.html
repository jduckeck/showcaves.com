        <h2>Description</h2>

        <div class="foreignText">

            <p>
                Just down the hill from
                <a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../il/subterranea/Warren.html"><img class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Misc.png" alt="Misc">Warren's Shaft</a>.
                The tunnel was built about 700 BC by King <b class="smallCaps">Hezekiah</b> to
                bring the water of Gihon into the city and store it in the pool of Shiloah, or
                Siloam. Its purpose was to prevent invaders, in particular the Assyrians, from
                locating the city's water supply and cutting it off (II Chronicles 32).
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The tunnel is narrow and wide in places, you can wade through it. The water is
                normally about half a metre deep. Due to the siphon effect it does occasionally
                rise, but only by about 15 to 20 cm.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The entrance steps leading down to the water are medieval, built due to the
                ground level having risen over the years. After about 20 meters the tunnel
                turns sharply to the left, where a chest high wall blocks another channel which
                leads to Warren's Shaft. Towards the tunnel's end the roof rises. This is
                because the tunnellers worked from either end and one team slightly misjudged
                the other's level. They had to lower the floor so that the water would flow. A
                Hebrew inscription was found in the tunnel, and a copy can be seen in the Israel
                Museum in the New City of Jerusalem. Carved by Hezekiah's engineers it tells of
                the tunnels construction.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                You enter the tunnel at the Gihon Spring source on Shiloah Way, down in the
                Kidron Valley and just south of the rest house. The wade takes about 30
                minutes; wear shorts and suitable footwear. Candles are available from the
                caretaker or a nearby shop.

            This water adit is really famous, as it is the greatest holdover of water
            engineering technology of the pre-Classical period.
            The only structure of comparable importance is the
            <a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../gr/subterranea/Eupalinus.html"><img class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Misc.png" alt="Misc">Tunnel of Eupalinus</a>
            on Samos in Greece.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This tunnel was made with contemporary technology, and exact surveying was not
            known at this time.
            The tunnel has many turns, the reason for the turns is unknown.
            Some talk about following a crack in the rock, others about following a small
            karst cave, which is was destroyed completely by the tunnel.
            Possible are also different rock types, which made deviations necessary.
            The tunnel is 530m long, but if it had been built in a straight line it would
            have been 335m long, about 40% shorter.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tunnel was built from both sides and the engineers managed to meet at last.
            The way they did this is not completetely solved, but most likely they heard the
            other team digging and headed towards the sound.
            There are also air vents to the surface which allowed "navigation".
