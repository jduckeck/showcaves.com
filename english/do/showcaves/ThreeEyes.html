        <p>
            <b>Los Tres Ojos</b> has - despite its name - four ponds.
            The first pond is of a perfect aquamarine tone, the second is the smallest and its water is sulphurous.
            The third, and biggest, is fresh water and has strong undercurrents.
            The most beautiful pond is the fourth pond which resembles the crater of a sleeping volcano.
            It is a cenote, which means the cave ceiling has collapsed and so the lake is
            now at the bottom of a shaft with vertical walls and sun is shining in.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave visit includes a boat ride across lake two.
            Then a concrete path leads through the upper chamber to the fourth pond.

        Three Eyes Cave   (Cueva Tres Ojos) is located in the Mirador del Este park in the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo. The name of the cave suggests that something in it should resemble "three eyes." These are three amazingly beautiful underground lakes located at a depth of 15 meters. 50 years ago, another lake was discovered in the cave - the fourth. But the name of the cave by this time has already become a brand.
The Three Eyes Cave is one of the most visited attractions in the country. The uniqueness of the three lakes available for visiting is that each of these lakes has its own chemical composition, which affects the color of lake water. Therefore, the water in them overflows from yellow-green to aquamarine. The water of one lake is sulfuric, in the other it is salty, and the third, the largest lake, is freshwater.

By their nature, they are karst lakes. Phantasmagoric figures from stalactites adorn the walls of the cave. Underground caves with lakes are amazingly beautiful. Numerous stalactites and stalagmites create an indescribably mysterious atmosphere. This is probably why the first inhabitants of the island, the ancient Taino Indians, once held their mystical rites in these caves.

Shooting with a flash is prohibited here, shooting with a camcorder is allowed.

Lakes were discovered in 1916. There is a theory according to which it is claimed that before there was only one lake, but as a result of an earthquake and the collapse of a part of the roof, the lake was divided into four lakes that communicate with each other:

"Blue Waters" (Aguas Azufradas) is the first lake whose name comes from its background substance blanquecida. Scientific studies have shown that it contains calcium and other minerals. The lake has a 4-meter depth.
"Freezer" (Nevera) is the second lake, whose name is associated with the low temperatures that are reached here because it never receives sunlight. The temperature of the lake ranges from +15 ° C and 21 ° C. There is a wooden boat on the lake to cross over to the fourth Zaramagullones lake. The lake has a depth of 5.4 m.
"Lake of Women" (El Lago de las Mujeres) is the third lake, the name of which comes from a shallow depth and was reserved for women and children: the depth of its deepest part is 2.5 m. Even Taino Indians noticed that women swimming in it have many children. But swimming is now officially not allowed in this lake.
zaramagullones Lake is the fourth lake, whose name comes from the species of amphibian ducks, which are native in this area of \u200b\u200bthe region. It has natural vegetation surrounding the lake. The lake has a depth of 6.1 m. It is the only lake that is in the open air and, therefore, is not recognized as an eye. It is round and has a circumference of about 223 m. The cave in which the last lake is located has partially collapsed and it is difficult to get to it.
  You can cross from one lake to another by ferry boats. In this place, several shootings were made in the Tarzan series - a human monkey.
The Three Eyes Cave is open to visitors from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: 50 pesos per person.
