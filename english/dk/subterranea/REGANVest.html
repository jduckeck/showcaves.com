        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Koldkrigsmuseet REGAN Vest</b> (Cold War Museum REGAN Vest) is located inside a Cold War bunker and in a newly built museum on the ground.
            It was hidden in Rold Skov (Rold Forest) in Northern Jutland, 60 m below ground.
            The bunker was intended for the government, officials and the royal family in the event of a nuclear war.
            From here the government was to rule the country in the event that the cold war suddenly became hot.
            It was big enough to support 350 people.
            The camouflage for the entrance was an unsuspicious yellow brick villa, a typical Danish home.
            The caretaker of the bunker actually lived in the house.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The museum opening was planned for the end of 2022.
            But it was postponed because of bats hibernating in the underground tunnels.
            It was now opened, but we are actually not sure if this means that the museum will be closed every winter.
            European bat protection law forbids the entering of bat caves, no matter if they are natural or artificial.
            If you intend to visit the museum during winter you should definitely checkt their website first.
            Actually it is necessary to book tickets online, there are no tickets sold on site, so if there are tickets in the ticket.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            It seems the bats are only a sort of diversionary attempt, the museum is only partly completed.
            Only the bunker itself is open to the public by now.
            The other two parts, the visitor center and museum, and the house of the caretaker are not completed.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The house of the caretaker was both, a camouflage and the home of the caretaker.
            A typical small house, like millions in Denmark, with definitely no exceptional detail.
            The living space of the caretaker is also quite ordinary, except probably for the fact that he had a quite tiny commute to work.
            The idea was security by absolute secrecy.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A few years ago there was an architecture competition which was won by architect <b>Anders Tyrrestrup</b> of MAA Aarhus.
            The plan is four black concrete boxes which will contain the ticket office and the museum.
            One wall is opened by a hydraulic system, which allows sunlight to shine in.
            Its closed not only during the night or storms, it is actually a part of a system which allows the simulation of an atomic war.
            The windows are closed and the virtual alternative of the actual surroundings, as they would look like after a nuclear war, is shown.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            We are not sure why they have so many restrictions in place.
            It's not allowed to eat your own sandwich in the visitor center, children are not allowed, and it is not allowed to take picture.
            They apologize quite politely before they tell you what you cant do.
            For a site which was constructed, maintained, and finally transformed into a museum with tax money, they are quite harsh with their financiers.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Most cold war bunkers in the world were decommissioned by the government in the 1990s, this bunker was operated rather long.
            The secrecy started to crumble in the 2000s, with the publication of the book <b>Danmarks dybeste hemmelighed</b> (Denmark's deepest secret) in 2009.
            The development of the bunker for the public was first suggested by Rebildcentret from nearby Thingbæk Kalkminer.
            At that time the bunker was actually decommissioned and the people which were involved were free to speak about the site.
            Rebildcentret was able to find 30 people who were involved in the construction and interview them about the undocumented events.
            They also created a cold war exhibition and an exhibition about this bunker, which are both much better than anything Nordjylland's Historical Museum has so far created at the bunker.
            At least for the near future it is advisable to combine any bunker tour with a visit to Thingbæk, which may be visited without prebooking.
        </p>
