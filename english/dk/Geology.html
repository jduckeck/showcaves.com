        <h1 class="center">Geology of Denmark</h1>

        <br>

        <p>
            Denmark is part of the huge Mesozoic basin which extends over northern France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, Germany and far into the east.
            This whole area was a basin with continual downlift for several hundred million years.
            Typically, 4.5 km of sediments was deposited, mostly marine sediments like limestone, marls, and sandstones, but also terrestrial sandstones and even evaporites like salt and gypsum.
            The uppermost sedimentary rocks are from the Cretaceous, later the area was land and subject to erosion.
            In the center of the basin, the British Channel, north German plains and Denmark, the white chalky limestone from this are survived and is typically found on teh surface.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            About 70 million years ago, Denmark was covered by a oxygene rich, rather shallow sea, the home of fish, squid, mussels, snails, sea urchins and sponges.
            These organisms can be found today as fossils.
            Billions of microorganisms lived in the upper water layers.
            The calcareous shells of these microorganisms form the chalk, if it is of particularly fine consistency it is called writing chalk.
            Black flint layers run through the chalk.
            They are the result of the quartz based shells of a part of the microorganisms, which was originally distributed finely through the chalk.
            Groundwater in the pores of the chalk had changing chemistry, and so there were areas where the quartz was dissolved and others wher eit was redeposited.
            The result are those bands or layers.
            The black color is mostly a result of the transparency, the light vanishes inside and is not reflected.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            During the Ice Age, the chalk was pressed downwards by the weight of mighty glaciers.
            Som parts were pulled along, others were massively eroded.
            The melting ice left huge blocks of crystalline rock originating on the Scandinavian craton.
            The northern part of Denmark was covered by 3.5 km of ice during the last ice age, the ice protruded sometimes to the Harz in Germany.
            But to the south it was thinner and thus less heavy.
            Since 12,000 years the ice is gone, as a result this area is subject to a continual uplift caused by isostatic forces as the crust is released from the weight.
            Like a ship being emptied, it lies less deep in the water.
            But geologic processes are slow, much slower than the melting, so it will take some more time until this neotectonic movement will come to an end.
            This process is called <b>post-glacial rebound</b>.
