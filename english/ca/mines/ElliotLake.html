        Officially designated as the Northern Home of the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame, the Museum greets visitors from all over the world and has received much acclaim for its quality exhibits and presentations.

        The Museum traces the history of the area from the early through the full circle of its industry from it origins to its
         state-of-the-art closure. Central to the exhibit, the Northern Home of the Canadian Mining Hall of Fame displays portraits of individuals who have demonstrated outstanding lifetime achievement in the mining industry. The Museum houses the Dr. Franc Joubin Mineral Collection plus much of his geology equipment including his pic, Geiger counter and technical library books on mining.

        Miner We have what we believe is the largest collection of mine rescue equipment perhaps in Ontario, if not Canada and an excellent facsimile of a mining stope designed by local high school students. The backdrop to the wildlife display is a landmark known as Horne Lake. This 47' x 10' mural was done by a local and talented wildlife artist.

        Our hours of operation are as follows:

        May long weekend to September long weekend:
        9 a.m. - 8 p.m. seven days a week
        September to May:

        The City of Elliot Lake Miner's Memorial Selection Committee is looking to memorialize those workers who lost their lives in accidents or died of occupational disease from working in the Elliot Lake mines.

        Miners Memorial Book - Memories From The Heart
        Family and friends are requested to write biographies of loved ones that lost their lives in accidents or died of occupational disease from working in the Elliot Lake mines.

        Mining Monument & Miners Memorial Park

        The Miners Monument was officially opened on April 28, 2007 to honour the community's mining legacy.

        Created by Laura Brown Breetvelt, a former Elliot Lake resident, this monument was built to honour the hard working miners who risked their lives each day and the community and families that supported them. Adjacent to the Monument lies the Mining Memorial, where names of workers from the Elliot Lake mines who died of workplace accidents or occupational illnesses are engraved for posterity. The Monument and Memorial Park provides a breathtaking view of the Horne Lake Escarpment and access to scenic nature trails as well as picnic facilities and parking

        Mining Memorial Name Submission

        The Memorial includes the names of fallen mine workers in the Elliot Lake camps who died of either occupational illness or workplace accidents. A process and criteria was established to allow for family members to apply and have the names of their loved ones added to the memorial. The criteria is purposely very explicit, allowing only fallen workers with proof (i.e. WSIB claim) of an occupational illness or accidental death to be added to the memorial structure.

        Commemorative Bricks

        Recognizing that many people do not meet the eligibility requirements for the memorial structure, commemorative bricks are available for purchase.  Following a similar, but less rigid, process for adding a name on the memorial, bricks are sold to a family member to commemorate any past worker, alive or deceased, at the Elliot Lake mining camps.  These bricks are engraved with the requested name and placed within the interlocking brick foundation of the Mining Monument and Memorial Park Site.

        The cost of a commemorative brick is $150.

        Commemorative Brick Application Form

        Requests or information regarding Monument name submissions and commemorative bricks can be placed with:
