        <h1 align="center">Cueva de Nerja</h1>
        <h2 align="center">by Tony Oldham</h2>

        <br clear="all">

        <p>
            Discovered in 1959 by some cavers from Maro: <b>Francisco Navas Montesinos</b>,
            <b>Miguel Mu&ntilde;oz Zorrilla</b>, <b>Manuel Mu&ntilde;oz Zorilla</b>,
            <b>Jos&eacute; Luis Barbero de Miguel</b>
            and <b>Jos&eacute; Torres C&aacute;rdenas</b>.
            They squeezed through a narrow hole in a dry sink called <b>La Mina</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave has three points of entry, two of them natural and one
            constructed in 1960 for tourists. The cave is 4,823 meters long with a
            vertical difference of 70 meters. It can be divided into three sections:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>The Show Cave, or Lower Galleries which has been developed for tourists with steps, concrete pathways and lighting.</li>
            <li>The Upper Galleries which were discovered in 1960 and</li>
            <li>The New Galleries which were discovered in 1969.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Well appointed service buildings include; ticket office, restaurant,
            cafeteria, souvenir shop, thankfully closed at the time of our visit,
            large car and coach parks. Admission 750 pts. Duration Â½ hour. Self
            guided tour. We took an hour. Guide book states no photography, but
            nobody objected. The chambers are so large that your average flash on a
            camera would not be of any use.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            From the entrance a descent of 8 meters down a flight of steps leads into
            the first chamber, the <b>Entrance Hall</b> [Sala del Vest&iacute;bulo], the site of an
            archaeological excavation. Some of the finds are shown in a display case
            and on explanatory panels. The cave continues down a narrow passage,
            about two meters high. The lower one metre has been excavated from
            beneath a stalagmite floor. As one enters the <b>Hall of the Nativity</b> [Sala
            del Bel&eacute;n], it is necessary to stop and smile and be photographed. The
            photos are ready when you leave the cave [500 pts each].
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Hall of the Nativity</b> is about 75 meters wide and 20 meters high with
            numerous columns going from floor to ceiling. A show case contains a
            stone age skeleton which was found in the cave. After retracing ones
            steps, a passage on the right called <b>Hall of the Tusk</b> [Sala del Colmillo]
            encircles the chamber and a steep flight of steps leads down into the
            <b>Hall of the Cascade</b> or <b>Ballet</b> [Sala de la Cascade or del Ballet]. Here
            festivals of music and dancing have been staged. One hopes a full
            orchestra will not be employed as the mighty bass notes could play havoc
            with the enormous stalactites in the ceiling. The auditorium consists of
            about 100 metal seats, so if you are going to an underground concert,
            bring a cushion! The rows of seats are supported on numerous RSJ's 3
            meters long 25 cm wide. They must have each weighed a ton and taken
            much blood, sweat and tears to get them this far into the cave. The
            stairway gives an excellent panoramic view, on the right are a series of
            dry rimstone pools or gours forming a <i>dry</i> cascade from whence the
            chamber gets its name. In the centre is a magnificent column over 15
            meters high and on the left are palettes and other impressive pendants.
            The roof is covered with vast numbers of colossal stalactites, hence my
            concerns at any musical vibrations.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Beyond the stage is the <b>Hall of Phantoms</b> [Sala de los Fantasmas], named
            after an unusual speleothem. It ends in a bottleneck resulting from a
            chaotic pile of fallen rocks. Above this is a spectacular stalagmite
            formation called the <b>Castle</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Taking the steps over the bottleneck leads into the <b>Hall of the Cataclysm</b>
            [Sala de Cataclismo]. From the viewing platform you can enjoy a
            wonderful two fold panorama: Looking back is the <b>Hall of the Phantoms</b>,
            whilst looking forward is one of the most impressive show cave scenes in
            the world: The <b>Hall of the Cataclysm</b> which is more than 100 meters long
            and 50 meters wide and over 30 meters high. The giant centre column is
            featured in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest in the world, it
            is 32 meters high and measures 13 x 7 meters at the base. A 800,000 year
            old earthquake displaced some stalactites which are now on the floor of
            the cave, which at this point is also the lowest point in the whole cave
            system.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The path divides and to the right one descends to a new landing known as
            the <b>Organ</b> [Los Organos], here fluted columns can be struck make different
            musical sounds, or so I am told. A circular route leads up some steps to
            a large circular seat which gives an impressive view of the massive
            central column, which, it is claimed, consists of 3,000 cubic meters of
            flowstone. It rests on large blocks and fallen fragments of older
            columns. More steps lead down to <b>The Bridge</b>. In the highest point close
            to the roof is a passage leading to the Upper and New Galleries. After
            crossing the <b>Bridge</b>, the path passes over a huge fallen block and rises
            as it circumnavigates the central column before rejoining the parting of
            the ways at the entrance to the <b>Hall of Cataclysm</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The return journey presents a new series of views as one retraces ones
            footsteps. In the <b>Hall of the Tusk</b>, a turning to the right leads to the
            exit and up a final flight of stairs, on the right is the padlocked steel
            door which leads to the <b>Hall of the Mine</b> and other sites of
            archaeological interest.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In conclusion, despite the unusual dryness, the enormous chambers and the wealth of speleothems makes this cave one of the top show
            caves in the world.
        </p>
