        The Prehistoric Park in Teverga houses the most relevant collection of Cave Art
        in Europe and it has between 10.000 and 40.000 years of antiquity. When visiting
        it, we can enjoy a wiser view about the Palaeolithic. Our visit will lasts for
        two hours and during this time we will be informed about daily life of the
        primitive man, mainly focusing on its hard reality, and sharing its way of
        seeing the world. In this same place we can also interpret more wisely all this
        cultural treasure, overall the wall paintings.


        All the information about this park is in this website
        www.parquedelaprehistoria.com

        It was 40.000 years ago when the first Homo Sapiens Sapiens came to Europe. They
        were moving towards the Neanderthal lands and at that moment he also became the
        dominant species. They used to live in caves and they also used to wear natural
        coats in this last phase of the Glacial Age. They were the first inhabitants
        endowed with a symbolic mentality and for that, they were also the first
        artists. The Cantabrian area (North of Spain) was a privileged scene for this
        kind of art, since after the last glaciation most Europe was inhabited to be
        fully covered by the ice. The Palaeolithic was then subscribed to mountains
        formed of limestone where there are lots of caves and, in Asturias have been
        found up today forty stations of Palaeolithic art, some of them really
        exceptional. Here we can find all types of prehistoric paintings in the Asturian
        caves, since the most remote to the magdaleniense style found in the famous Cave
        of Tito Bustillo.

        It is placed only at 40 kilometers from the city of Oviedo, in the locality of
        San Salvador of Alesga (Teverga). This Prehistoric Park is the biggest whole of
        replicas of that stage of Humankind, with exact copies of the main European
        deposits of Palaeolithic painting and movement art, all these selected upon a
        rigorous scientific criteria. These are wonderful reproductions, copies,
        recreations, photographies, models and reconstructions. The replicas, very
        reliable to the original ones, are organized according to a didactic and
        enjoyable aim.

        The location of this park is in a valley of great ecological value and
        surrounded by a natural wonderful landscape far from human settlements. This
        museum is under the ground so, in this way we get closer to daily life of cave
        men. There are 25 virgin hectares down Peña Sobia, just in the middle of the
        Natural Park of the Ubiñas.

        This museum is formed by three buildings. In the first one there is the
        reception and the Café. After a short walk and crossing the river Páramo over a
        new bridge, we can see another building shaped as a half moon, covered with
        vegetation and called La Galeria. Then we are entering in a space of more than
        one thousand square meters. Inside we can find a complex audiovisual circuit,
        documents, painting reproductions and different engravings of the Superior
        Palaeolithic, such as the one of the horses of Chauvet and the black cow of
        Lascaux, both in France. On the central ceiling we find the Altamira bisons
        (made by the same people who did the replica of the Altamira Caves in the museum
        of Altamira and, those works lasted for two years in order to get an exact
        reproduction of the paintings). Inside this room we can also find replicas of
        the Camarín of deers in Covalanas (Cantabria), the Bear Groute in Ekain (Pais
        Vasco), The Bisons of La Covaciella in Cabrales (Asturias), the sign panel in
        the cave of Llonín in Peñamellera Alta (Asturias), and different old tools and
        figures from Spain, France, Germany, Austria, Chequia or Russia.

        In this artificial gallery we can understand better why the Palaeolithic art
        emerged, who and which techniques were used on cave paintings, and what is the
        real meaning that has been given to them in last two hundred years by scientific
        searchers. From each cave most important paintings have been chosen, in order to
        show more clearly the prehistoric artist's motivation.

        Some theories link these paintings with spare time, fertility, hunting but
        others try to prove shamen did them under certain altered states of
        consciousness. This could be based on the idea that they were venerating some
        animals, so they would draw them on the walls, creating at the same time a
        signed codified language. The cave would be female, symbolizing all her ulterior
        world.

        The third building, next to the previous one, is called "Cueva de Cuevas" and
        this name is due to its relevant three cave galleries. These are exact copies
        made of natural diers, the same used in those ages. The limestone of the walls
        and ceilings has the same appearance as in those times, with some cracks and
        light reflections and its structure, humidity, darkness and silence have been
        also kept. In a 25 minute visit we can go through these three places, beginning
        by the Gallery of Horses of Tito Bustillo where we can appreciate the richness
        of horse representations. From this cave we move to the replica of The Cave of
        Niaux (the original is in France) to contemplate the Black Site, where we find
        the most well figured drawings. From this second building we come back to
        Asturias to observe the reproduction of the Camerín of the Cave of Candamo where
        we are explained how these first artists looked for an image, and after they
        drew it on their cave walls attending to their relieves. Along this visit we are
        walking down a irregular and uneven ground as if were inside the original caves.
        In some cases we may follow a lantern light because of its interior darkness.

        To sum up we can say that The Prehistoric Park of Teverga is unique and its
        replicas are of extraordinary realism. This is the opinion of Jean Clottes,
        responsible for the scientific research in the cave of Chauvet. He is the
        general curator of the French patrimony and today he is the current president of
        the International Committee of Cave Art.
