<!-- TODO -->

<!--
The Prehistoric Park in Teverga houses the most relevant collection of Cave Art
in Europe and it has between 10.000 and 40.000 years of antiquity. When visiting
it, we can enjoy a wiser view about the Palaeolithic. Our visit will lasts for
two hours and during this time we will be informed about daily life of the
primitive man, mainly focusing on its hard reality, and sharing its way of
seeing the world. In this same place we can also interpret more wisely all this
cultural treasure, overall the wall paintings.


All the information about this park is in this website
www.parquedelaprehistoria.com

It was 40.000 years ago when the first Homo Sapiens Sapiens came to Europe. They
were moving towards the Neanderthal lands and at that moment he also became the
dominant species. They used to live in caves and they also used to wear natural
coats in this last phase of the Glacial Age. They were the first inhabitants
endowed with a symbolic mentality and for that, they were also the first
artists. The Cantabrian area (North of Spain) was a privileged scene for this
kind of art, since after the last glaciation most Europe was inhabited to be
fully covered by the ice. The Palaeolithic was then subscribed to mountains
formed of limestone where there are lots of caves and, in Asturias have been
found up today forty stations of Palaeolithic art, some of them really
exceptional. Here we can find all types of prehistoric paintings in the Asturian
caves, since the most remote to the magdaleniense style found in the famous Cave
of Tito Bustillo.

It is placed only at 40 kilometers from the city of Oviedo, in the locality of
San Salvador of Alesga (Teverga). This Prehistoric Park is the biggest whole of
replicas of that stage of Humankind, with exact copies of the main European
deposits of Palaeolithic painting and movement art, all these selected upon a
rigorous scientific criteria. These are wonderful reproductions, copies,
recreations, photographies, models and reconstructions. The replicas, very
reliable to the original ones, are organized according to a didactic and
enjoyable aim.

The location of this park is in a valley of great ecological value and
surrounded by a natural wonderful landscape far from human settlements. This
museum is under the ground so, in this way we get closer to daily life of cave
men. There are 25 virgin hectares down Pe&ntilde;a Sobia, just in the middle of the
Natural Park of the Ubi&ntilde;as.

This museum is formed by three buildings. In the first one there is the
reception and the Caf&eacute;. After a short walk and crossing the river P&aacute;ramo over a
new bridge, we can see another building shaped as a half moon, covered with
vegetation and called La Galeria. Then we are entering in a space of more than
one thousand square meters. Inside we can find a complex audiovisual circuit,
documents, painting reproductions and different engravings of the Superior
Palaeolithic, such as the one of the horses of Chauvet and the black cow of
Lascaux, both in France. On the central ceiling we find the Altamira bisons
(made by the same people who did the replica of the Altamira Caves in the museum
of Altamira and, those works lasted for two years in order to get an exact
reproduction of the paintings). Inside this room we can also find replicas of
the Camar&iacute;n of deers in Covalanas (Cantabria), the Bear Groute in Ekain (Pais
Vasco), The Bisons of La Covaciella in Cabrales (Asturias), the sign panel in
the cave of Llon&iacute;n in Pe&ntilde;amellera Alta (Asturias), and different old tools and
figures from Spain, France, Germany, Austria, Chequia or Russia.

In this artificial gallery we can understand better why the Palaeolithic art
emerged, who and which techniques were used on cave paintings, and what is the
real meaning that has been given to them in last two hundred years by scientific
searchers. From each cave most important paintings have been chosen, in order to
show more clearly the prehistoric artist's motivation.

Some theories link these paintings with spare time, fertility, hunting but
others try to prove shamen did them under certain altered states of
consciousness. This could be based on the idea that they were venerating some
animals, so they would draw them on the walls, creating at the same time a
signed codified language. The cave would be female, symbolizing all her ulterior
world.

The third building, next to the previous one, is called "Cueva de Cuevas" and
this name is due to its relevant three cave galleries. These are exact copies
made of natural diers, the same used in those ages. The limestone of the walls
and ceilings has the same appearance as in those times, with some cracks and
light reflections and its structure, humidity, darkness and silence have been
also kept. In a 25 minute visit we can go through these three places, beginning
by the Gallery of Horses of Tito Bustillo where we can appreciate the richness
of horse representations. From this cave we move to the replica of The Cave of
Niaux (the original is in France) to contemplate the Black Site, where we find
the most well figured drawings. From this second building we come back to
Asturias to observe the reproduction of the Camer&iacute;n of the Cave of Candamo where
we are explained how these first artists looked for an image, and after they
drew it on their cave walls attending to their relieves. Along this visit we are
walking down a irregular and uneven ground as if were inside the original caves.
In some cases we may follow a lantern light because of its interior darkness.

To sum up we can say that The Prehistoric Park of Teverga is unique and its
replicas are of extraordinary realism. This is the opinion of Jean Clottes,
responsible for the scientific research in the cave of Chauvet. He is the
general curator of the French patrimony and today he is the current president of
the International Committee of Cave Art.
