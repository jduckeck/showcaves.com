        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Ojukwu Bunker</b>, located behind the <b>Biafra State House</b>, Umuahia, is also called <b>Biafra Bunker</b>.
            It was the <i>subterranean office</i> for the Biafra government during the Nigeria civil war, between 1967 and 1970.
            Its official name is <b>Subterranean Office of the Government of Biafra</b>.
            As this government was led by General <b class="smallCaps">Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu</b> the name <b>Ojukwu Bunker</b> was used by the people and stuck.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The bunker is 8 m below ground and bombproof.
            It has a conference room, parlor, bedroom, kitchen, store, bathroom, toilet and a cell where prisoners of war were kept.
            The entrance is behind the Biafra State House, formerly the house of the Premier of the then Eastern Region, Chief <b class="smallCaps">Michael Okpara</b>.
            There is a tiny concrete building which was camouflaged with green colour, where the staircase down to the bunker starts.
            The structural design was made by Dr. <b class="smallCaps">Chuba Agbim</b> and construction was done by engineer <b class="smallCaps">Joel Onyemelukwe</b>.
            The construction time was 90 days.
            Today the bunker contains a small exhibition on the Civil War.
            It also contains a now empty safe which once contained the secret documents of the country.
            The bunker is entered down the staircase, but it is left by climbing up a iron ladder in a concrecte shaft.
            However, visitors who are not able or willing to do so may use the staircase.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The war was the result of the independence of Nigeria from the United Kingdom.
            The state borders differed from the ethic boundaries before colonization, and so there were three groups in the country, the Muslim northerners of the Sokoto Calipahte, the Yoruba in the southwest and the Igbo in the southeast, which were Christians.
            Growing ethnic tensions resulted in ethnic and religious riots, military coups, dead politicians and more.
            Finally in January 1967, the leaders meet and suggested a less centralised union of regions with more independence for all.
            All agreed, but the federal government (consisting of northerners) reneged on the agreement and unilaterally declared new changes including the gerrymandering of the Igbos.
            General <b class="smallCaps">Ojukwu</b> ws the military governor of Eastern Nigeria and led the secessionist movement.
            On 26-MAY-1967 <b class="smallCaps">Ojukwu</b> decreed secession from Nigeria to become the independent <b>Republic of Biafra</b>, with Enugu as its capital.
            But the oil reserves in the area were too important and so the government attacked Biafra on 26-MAY-1967.
            Soon the government was supported by the British, American and Soviet governments, who were interested in the oil.
            Numerous air raids on the city lead to the construction of the bunker, which was the home of General <b class="smallCaps">Ojukwu</b> and the command center.
            After 2 Million dead Biafran civilians, one third children, they finally surrendered in January 1970.
            The winners turned out to be quite resentful, they confiscated all land where people had fled from the war, seized all bank accounts owned by Biafrans and left every Igbo only 20 pounds.
            They also reduced public projects massively compared to other parts of Nigeria.
            And the Nigerian security forces made illegal roadblocks and forced the Igbos to pay money for passage, and much more.
            Obviously a very dark chapter in Nigerias history.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            We have given open hours and fees, but they seem to be rather volatile.
            Especially the fees seem to be quite individual and a matter of haggling.
            There is electric light in the bunker, but if you buy the normal entrance ticket it is not turned on.
            They tell you, you have to pay a much higher fee when they turn on the generator.
            Obviously bunkers are equipped with generators, but today they are connected to the grid, if they are museums.
            We guess the guys at the ticket office found a great way to scam visitors.
            If you do not want to confront them you could haggle.
            Another pont is the photography.
            There seems to be security personell at the gate which forces you to leave the bag at the entrance, including cameras and smartphones.
            So it’s not possible to take pictures inside.
            The explanation for this are "insecure times", which actually only explains that they check the bags, not that they keep them while you are in.
            We guess if you pay a security fee (bribe) you might be allowed to take your camera inside.
            And finally, we read different reports about guided tours.
            They are quite different and seem to depend on various things.
            We guess the looks of the female visitors is one decision criterion.
        </p>
