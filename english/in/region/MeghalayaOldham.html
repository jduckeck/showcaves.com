                Meghalaya means <b>The Abode of the Clouds</b>.
                It is a north eastern state bordering Bangladesh in the south and Asam in the
                north, it is reputed to be the wettest place on earth but is also a land of
                caves, with more than 500 according to <b class="smallCaps">B.D. Kharpan
                Daly</b>, General Secretary of the Shillong based <b>Meghalaya Adventurers
                Association</b> which was formed in 1990.
                One reason for the abundance of caves could be the heavy rain in the region
                reacting with the limestone deposits.
                He claims with confidence that the figure would go up to 1000.
