        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The <b>ଉଦୟଗିରି ଓ ଖଣ୍ଡଗିରି ଗୁମ୍ଫା</b> (Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves) are a huge number of artificial caves and cave temples of Jain and Buddhist origin.
            They are named after the twin hills of Khandagiri (Sunset Hill) and Udayagiri (Sunrise Hill) in Bhubaneswar city.
            They were formerly called Kattaka Caves or Cuttack Caves, a name which included both groups of caves.
            The caves were built since the 1st century BC as residential caves for Jaina monks during the reign of King <b class="smallCaps">Kharavela</b>.
            Today Udayagiri has 18 caves while Khandagiri has 15 caves, but the number of cave changed continually, mostly because they were differently counted.
            The caves are today divided by Khandagiri Temple Road.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Udayagiri caves are more beautiful and better maintained.
            Notable is <b>ଅନନ୍ତ ଗୁମ୍ଫା ଖଣ୍ଡଗିରି</b> (Ananta Gumpha, Ananta Cave) with its carved figures of elephants and women.
            <b>ହାତୀଗୁମ୍ଫା ଶିଳାଲେଖ</b> (Hathigumpha Inscription) is an impressively chiseled inscription in the flattened rock face of <b>Hathigumpha Cave</b> (Elephant Cave).

                A few km west of Bhubaneswar city centre are two hills, facing each other
                honeycombed with caves, most of which are numbered. Udayagiri or Sunrise
                hill to the north of the approach road has the most interesting caves
                which contain some fine sculptures.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Cave No 1 Rani Gupha. This is the largest and most elaborate cave
                residence of the series. Numerous small cells excavated on two levels
                around three sides of a large court are sheltered by collapsed
                colonnades. The cell doorways are embellished with pilasters crowned by
                animals on the capitals. On the walls flanking the end pilasters are
                guardian figures, some in foreign dress (upper storey, right wing). The
                relief arches over the doorways have lotus ornaments; they are connected
                by a railing frieze. On either side of the arches are carved panels. On
                the lower storey these represent pious couples and musicians and dancers
                (side wings), and scenes of nature with birds and animals (corner rooms).
                On the better-preserved upper storey there are episodes from an
                unidentified narrative: these depict, left to right, an attendant with a
                tray; elephants before a man with a club; an attendant woman; a fight
                between a man and a woman; the abduction of a woman; a riderless horse
                sheltered by a parasol; a hunter aiming at a winged deer; a hunter with a
                woman in a tree; and a seated woman with attendants.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Cave Nos 3, 4 and 5 There are elephants carved in relief flank in the
                arch over the entrance to Cave No 3. In the adjoining two-storey Cave No
                4 are sculptures of elephants, lions and pairs of winged animals on
                column brackets in the upper storey.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Cave 5, which is also two storeyed, is linked with the upper cell of Cave
                4. Here, figures are carved on the end pilasters. Above the doorways to
                the two cells are arches within which there is a depiction of a sacred
                tree surrounded by a railing.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Cave No 9 This is a complex of cells arranged on two storeys. On the
                lower level, armed guardians (worn) are carved on to the end pilasters of
                the verandah. The doorways within are surmounted by relief arches,
                between which is a scene (damaged) with royal figures worshipping at a
                shrine. The cave is distinguished by an inscription donated by the Chedi
                rulers.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Cave No 10, Ganesha Gupha. This is named after the image of the Hindu
                elephant god which was carved at a later date on to the rear wall of the
                right cell. In front of the cave are two detached monolithic elephants
                lifting branches with their trunks. The cave itself consists of two
                low-roofed cells with four doorways and a verandah. A guardian holding a
                spear is carved on to the left pilaster; the other pilasters have male or
                female figures caved on them. Each doorway is surmounted by relief
                arches between which are depictions of a fight, an abduction and an
                elopement (similar to the scenes in Cave 1).
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Cave No 12. Bagh Gupha. The entrance to this cave is shaped into the
                semblance of the head of an open mouthed tiger. [Tiger = Bagh]
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Cave No 14 Elephant Cave contains a 117 line inscription describing its
                builder as King Kharaveli of Kalinga who ruled from 168 to 153 BC.
