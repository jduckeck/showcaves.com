        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Deir Mar Antonios</b> (Monastery of Saint Anthony) was founded in the 4th century in an oasis in the Eastern Desert of Egypt.
            It was dedicated to Saint <b class="smallCaps">Anthony the Great</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b class="smallCaps">Anthony</b> was born to a wealthy family in Lower Egypt around 251.
            His parents died when he was eight years old.
            At the age of 34 he heard <b class="smallCaps">Mark</b> in which he was told to give up all of his belongings and seek God.
            He donated all his properties to charity and ventured into the Eastern Desert to seek a life of spiritual reflection.
            He was illiterate and took the words he heard in a literal sense.
            He made his abode in a small cave where he practiced an ascetic life.
            Although St. <b class="smallCaps">Anthony</b> was not the first hermit, he attracted many followers and disciples.
            He is one of the fathers of modern Christian monasticism.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            After the death of Saint <b class="smallCaps">Anthony</b> his followers still lived around the hermit cave.
            Between 298–300, during the reign of <b class="smallCaps">Constantius Chlorus</b>, the first monastery was erected.
            Monks lived in solitary cells surrounding a communal center where they performed the Divine Liturgy.
            There was a refectory where they took their daily meals.
            But the focus on asceticism diminished with time.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The monastery grew in the 6th and 7th century when frequent attack by Bedouins and Berbers forced monks from the monasteries of Scetes to flee to the Monastery of Saint Anthony.
            It was raided and even destroyed various times.
            After a decline during the 19th century it was revived, and since the construction of a road it is accessible by car.
            Before the only way to reach it was to take a camel caravan to the nearby village Bush, which took several days.
            In the 1950s about 370 visitors came to the monastery in the whole decade, which was an substantial increase.
            Today the monastery has several thousand visitors on holiday weekends.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave of St. <b class="smallCaps">Anthony</b> is a 2 km hike from the monastery up a long staircase.
            The ascend takes about an hour.
            The cave is only 7 m long, St. <b class="smallCaps">Anthony</b> was serious about his ascetic life.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There is also a new <b>Church of Resurrection</b> outside the monastery complex.
            The cave entrance is quite impressive as the cliff face was sculpted with crucifixion scenes and the entrance itself looks like the round door of a Hobbit home.
            We guess it is actually a replica of a typical rock tomb in Jerusalem, like the one where <b class="smallCaps">Jesus</b> was buried before his resurrection.
        </p>
