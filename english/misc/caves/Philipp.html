        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Philipp's Cave</b> is a cave shelter or abri in insoluble granite rocks,
            formed by erosion.
            It is famous for its Bushman paintings which include hunting scenes, antelopes,
            and a <b>White Elephant</b>.
            The cave is located on the <b>Ameib Game Ranch</b>, in the Erongo Mountains.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Nearby is a group of strangely formed rocks and boulders which is called the
            <b>Bull's Party</b>.
            This geotope is well worth a visit.
            The visit of both, the cave and the rock formation will take about four hours.
            The temperature may rise to 40Â°C in summer and
        </p>

        <!--

        Introduction: If you are driving in the Karibib / Usakos area you should try to
        plan a visit to the  It nestles .
        Here you can see the famous Philipp's Cave which has some excellent
        examples of Ancient Bushman Paintings; and also the area known as  where the surrealistic rock formations and massive boulders perched
        precariously on top of each other will present a challenge to your imagination
        and photography capabilities. Some of the granite rock faces on the farm also
        offer an interesting challenge to enthusiast rock climbers.

        If you are not planning to overnight on the Ameib Ranch you should budget a
        minimum of 4 hours which should just give you enough time to visit the Bull's
        Party and the Philipp's Cave. Mid day temperatures in summer can reach 40c.
        There's an amount of reflection from the rocks, so wear a high protection factor
        sun screen and carry enough water.

        Philipps Cave the path is marked

        Marked path

        The Hike:  It's about a half hour hike to the cave. There's a bit of boulder
        hopping required, but you don't have to be an athlete to get there. The path is
        signed with painted arrows and circles. Keep looking for these direction signs
        as it can be a bit inconvenient if you wander off track. If you are visiting in
        the rainy season be careful when climbing on the granite rock faces. They are
        wind polished and can become very slippery.

        The Cave:  When at the cave you can appreciate why the Bushmen made this a
        resting or ritual point. The natural shelter and excellent viewpoint offered
        safety and an amount of security. The Cave was formed from the granite by what
        is referred to as being Tafoni Weathering which usually takes place on the
        shaded side of rock formations. The Philipps Cave faces in a northerly
        direction. However, the site being north of the Tropic of Capricorn does
        experience shade during the early months of the rainy season - December and
        January. It was during these 'wet' periods that this particular area of rock
        began to disintegrate. Further erosion was caused by wind blown sands.

        The Philipp's Cave Bushman Paintings: The French rock painting expert Abbe Henri
        Breuil who had visited the Brandberg in 1947 and made a lengthy study of the
        White Lady Of Brandberg painting also made a further visit to Namibia in 1950.
        He spent some time on the farm Ameib at the invitation of owner Emil Philipp who
        had discovered the cave on the farm housing bushman paintings.

        Abbe Breuil's book Philipp's Cave contains an extensive commentary on the cave
        paintings and it can be seen that his understanding of the Ameib paintings was
        influenced by his earlier theory that people from the Eastern Mediterranean had
        long ago made their way to this southern corner of Africa. He noted similarities
        in the style of certain of the paintings and postulated that they were the work
        of the same artists or of similar influence. Of the procession of human figures
        he deduced, 'of these people six clearly have European profiles and one is of
        Semitic type....... all of these details show clearly that these people belong
        to the world of the White Lady. The only thing lacking, and invariably lacking
        is that no one wears the arm, leg and breast bands, beaded or otherwise, worn by
        the figures in the White Lady group, nor is there any evidence of shoes.' He
        further wrote, ' with faces of European type and page (boy) hair; these must,
        therefore, be foreigners of Nilotic (Egypt) origin.

        The Abbe's conclusions as to the origin of the people depicted on the cave
        paintings were later proven to be incorrect. However, the book has excellent
        photographs and commentary of the animals and aging of the artwork.

        Following the hike to the cave, and particularly if it is hot, you might be
        feeling a bit 'whacked'. Have a rest, drink some water. and then carefully study
        the paintings. Some of them may look a bit faded, but, seek and you will find.
        There are some very interesting figures. For example the below left photo shows
        a hunter with hair styled that was once mistaken for a helmet of some kind. Look
        at the graceful stance of the antelope, above row of pictures left. The oldest
        of the paintings are claimed to be of the larger animals. The white elephants
        and the giraffe having a red head. The large animals in black can also be from
        this period.  The smaller white and red animals, giraffe, quagga, and ostriches
        and possibly those to the right of the cave including the man apparently
        apparently hunting the ostrich are thought to be from a middle period.

        It is thought that the Springbok and procession of people carrying weapons are
        from a later period.
