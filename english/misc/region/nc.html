<h2 align="center">New Caledonia</h2>

<br clear="all">

<table class="foreign">
<tr><td>

<p>
This former French colony is a very mountainous Pacific island with a
limestone karst of considerable potential.  <b>New Caledonia</b>, the <b>Loyalty
Islands</b> and the <b>Isle of Pines</b> have a karst area of over 2,000 square km.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Only a small fraction of the underworld has been explored and a hundred
or so caverns have been listed, so there is much potential for further
underground investigation.  Some of the caves are accessible to keen
tourists, as long as they are careful and respect the beauty of the
sites.  Others are reserved for speleologists with a penchant for
adventure. Visiting caves usually requires the presence of a local guide
and the need to bring your own lights.  Many cave are on private or holy
land, so remember to ask for permission from local authorities.
</p>


<h2>The Mainland</h2>

<p>
The karst landscapes of the mainland were formed about 60 million years
ago.  There are some important caves at Yat&eacute;.
</p>

<h3>Yat&eacute;</h3>

<p>
The Touaourou caves have the curious feature of a vault pierced through
by the roots of Banyan trees which form veritable curtains.  They are
easy to visit.  You must simply ask for permission from the neighbouring
tribe.  Still in Yat&eacute;, a short walk along the coast leads to the entrance
of the Wekou siphon and the impressive eddy which it causes at high tide.
</p>


<h3>Poya</h3>

<p>
<b>Adio Cave</b> L 6 km is the longest in New Caledonia.  For more than 50
years, a Melanesian guide, Albert Gorodite, has been leading visitors
into the bowels of the earth.  He is easily found by asking at the Poya
town hall.  The main network follows a subterranean riverbed for about 3
km, which represents 3 hours of walking, before emerging lower down in
the forest.  The first 150 meters involves wading and is it difficult to
avoid getting wet.  This leads to the great gallery of the cave.  It
measures about 10 meters in diameter.  In various places tributaries flow
into the main stream, these are subterranean rivers yet to be fully
explored.  A visit to the cave is only for very fit people who are not
afraid of getting completely wet through.  The cave contains some very
beautiful speleothems which are extremely fragile and very rare.  Great
care should be taken to avoid damaging them.  There are numerous
chambers, narrow corridors beneath dripping vaults, and at the end a fun
labyrinth with a forced bath in very clear waters.
</p>


<h3>Koumac and Kaala-Gomen</h3>

<p>
Situated 10 km from the west coast, the massif of Koumac covers a surface
area of about 20 km&sup2; and its highest peak rises to 374 m asl.  It is
intersected by a canyon and the Koumac river and features two major
phenomena: the Poultier hole and the Koumac cave.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The <b>Poultier hole</b> is a vast closed off depression 3 km long and 200
meters deep.  Karst towers dominate this depression which constitutes one
of the most beautiful landscapes in New Caledonia.  Two riverbeds run
through it: the "Great Forest" river to the west and the "Poultier River"
to the east.  WARNING: during heavy rainfall, these generally dry rivers
are capable of receiving very large quantities of water, so you should
not venture into them during flood times as the flow-rate can get up to
100m&sup2; per second.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<b>The Koumac Cave</b>.  L 3.7 km  The route is quite easy and the complete
visit, to this very beautiful cave, takes about 3 hours.  In December 8,
2000 the cave appeared on a stamp issued by the postal authorities.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The Kaala-Gomen massif covers a surface area of about 10 km&sup2;.  It has
been very little explored and does not appear to contain a large system.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The minor karsts: <b>Hiengh&egrave;ne</b> and <b>Houailou</b>
These diverse karst areas are of small size and the caves found there are
modest.  The great hall of the Lind&eacute;ralique cave in Hiengh&egrave;ne, is worth a
detour for its size and location.  In Houailou, the little Nindhia massif
encloses a cave of about 100 m long.  It was explored in 1975 by
Australians.
</p>


<h2>L'&icirc;le des Pins</h2>

<p>
This island in the South province contains ten or more caves, most of
which contain active underground rivers.  Only a few of them are open to
the public:
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The <b>Oumagne cave</b>: it is possible to explore the first 200 meters, up to a
small chamber that ends in a collapse.  At the end you can find a flat
platform which once served as a bed for Queen Hortense.  At this point
the river disappears underground and can only be explored by experienced
speleologists who can continue another 1,000 meters into the Ouatchia
cave : this site is taboo for some.  This is where Queen Hortense
supposedly hid before abdicating in 1883.
</p>


<h2>Les Iles Loyaut&eacute;</h2>

<p>
The Loyalty Islands are of great interest to cavers.  It seems that caves
were formed as recently as 300,000 years ago, when the sea level was 120
meters above its current level.  Following one of the great events of our
recent geological past, the glaciations, which had the effect of
solidifying the ocean into ice, the lowest point was reached: 15,000
years ago when the sea level was 100 meters below the current level.
Rainwater infiltrated the massif and ran out into the ocean, carving out
passages at the same level as the that of the ocean.  Each time the ocean
level dropped, more caves were formed.  It is these caves that are being
discovered today.  The deepest and most recent caves are therefore 100
meters below the current sea level.  The rising water table which took
place during the last fifteen thousand years was spectacular.  The
deepest caves were completely submerged and are now channels through
which water penetrates inland.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
On these coral islands, most of the caves are holy sites.  Visiting caves
is not a very well developed tourist activity.  This has allowed the many
limestone concretions that form fragile mineral sculptures to be
preserved.  However, informed tourists can visit some caves with a guide.
</p>


<h3>Ouvea</h3>

<p>
The island of Ouvea has 23 caves.  They are of course difficult places to
visit as they are not suitable for tourists.  However, if you are an
experienced cave diver, make sure you get customary permission and
organise your transport and gear carefully.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The blue waterhole of <b>Aben d'Anawa</b> is located in the centre of the
island, this is a cenote where rainwater collects and then forms two
layers, fresh water and salt water.  Anawa is the narrowest part of the
isthmus.  It marks the boundary between the districts of Fayaou&eacute; and
W&eacute;n&eacute;ki.  The waterhole is home to a submerged forest at about 40 meters
below the surface, at this point the underwater cave is 100 meters long
and 60 meters wide.  Another forest, this time of stalagmites and
stalactites, proves that the island recently submerged and that the
concretions and trees were able to develop in the open air before being
drowned.  Some of these holes are used as natural swimming pools by the
children of the island, others shelter turtles.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The <b>L&eacute;kine cliffs</b> are situated 6 km south of Fayaou&eacute;.
These high, grey, cliffs are riddled with caves facing the bay.
Along the beach to the east, a pathway leads to the beginning of the swamp, between the stretch
of sand and the cliffs.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The <b>Cong-Ouloup cave</b> can only be visited with the permission of the
tribal chief, and also by undergoing the 'custom' rites.  Legend has it
that when the mainlanders invaded the island of Ouvea, the cave gave
shelter to the gods of Canala.  A track which leads to the top of the
cliff offers a magnificent view.
</p>


<h3>Lifou</h3>

<p>
It is in Lifou that the largest number of caves have been found.  Out of
25 caves discovered, only 5 are open to tourists, and they can only be
visited in the presence of a guide.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The <b>Quajo cave</b> in Qanono: to get there you have to walk through a forest.
 Coming out of the bushes in front of a greyish mass, you will find the
entrance to the cave 20 meters further down.  For those who want to go
in, you will first have to swim along a dark corridor, carved out by the
waters, before arriving in a natural swimming pool, surrounded by
limestone terraces.  This is where the dry cave begins.  Watch out, you
must follow the guide rope as you can easily get lost.  Bring a
waterproof torch so that you can admire the mineral sculptures found in
each chamber.  They are superb, some resemble beds of diamonds on the
cave walls, others are called "the eccentrics" because of their strange
crazy shapes, deifying gravity.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The <b>Luenghoni Cave</b> is only suitable for experienced cave divers.  It is a
flooded gallery more than 150 meters long and 30 meters deep.  A true
labyrinth, its many passages lead in all directions.  You have to be
careful following the guide rope.  You plunge into the cold water then
follow a lamp leading you to ever more beautiful chambers.  The route
leads past banyan tree roots falling into the water and stalactites
reflected in limpid pools, you will also pass by fossilized shells.  In
the water are to be found eels and thermoclines, transparent fish with
blind white eyes.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The <b>Devil's Caves</b>, are 5 km from the aerodrome and the path to the caves
is clearly marked.  Once there, you have to contact the guide and
remember to bring a torch.  These caves abound with legends.  The Qanopeu
Cave (meaning "entrails of the earth where spirits are born"), includes
three chambers.  The second of these, about 40 meters long, is home to
bats.  The third is the Devil's Bedroom with, at the back, a collapsed
passage which used to lead to the sea.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The <b>Xodre cave</b> is between the cliffs and the sea, on the warrior route,
is a cave you can visit.
</p>


<h3>Mare</h3>

<p>
The most elevated of the Loyalty Islands contains 14 caves including one
of the largest underwater caves in the world.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The <b>Bone de la L&eacute;proserie</b> is a chasm which begins with a 50 metre well
which, after climbing down a rope, ends up in a 40 metre deep lake.  The
entrance to this chasm only measures 25 meters in diameter, but the
subterranean lake is 160 meters in diameter at its base.  This is one of
the largest flooded chambers, if not the largest, with 350,000 m3 of
fresh water.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The <b>Bone Hole</b> or <b>Hole of the Lion</b> is a chasm 40 meters deep.  The
entrance is 45 meters in diameter.  You can go to the edge of the
circular cliff, in the middle of a tropical forest, and have a look down
for hidden openings surrounding the dark-coloured lake.  This 12 metre
deep lake is unfortunately completely closed in and the gulf, at the
bottom, reaches a diameter of 100 meters
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The <b>Pethoene cave</b> is near the M&eacute;du tribal village, 50 meters from the
roadside, follow the little track leading through the forest to find the
cave.
