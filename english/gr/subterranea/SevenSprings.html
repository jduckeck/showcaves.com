        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            This site is called <b>Επτά Πηγές</b> (Epta Piges, 7 Springs) and has four main attractions, or probably ten, depends on how you count.
            The area is karstified, and in this small valley near the village Kolympia are seven small karst springs which form a tributary of Λουτάνης (Loutanis river).
            Nearby is a second tributary of the same river, and the problem is that this river falls dry during summer, and the water of the tributaries also dries up before it reaches the village at the sea.
            The water of the seven springs was originally used for a watermill, but at some point the watermills were abandoned for mills powered by electricity.
            The water was needed for irrigation too, and there were fertile fields in the plain near the estuary of Loutanis river.
            With growing population and growing tourist numbers drinking water became also much more important.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Around 1945 there were workers which constructed canals and a dam with a reservoir.
            In this year <b class="smallCaps">Stefanos Petas</b> opened a small café offering coffee and traditional food of the era to the water mill workers and the workers of the irrigation system.
            He called it Epta Piges Taverna Restaurant.
            There was no electricity, so he used gas for cooking and for the refrigerators, there was a generator for the electric light.
            It was like this until 1990, when they were finally connected to the electric grid.
            And there was actually no road to the place, only a narrow trails, the paved road was built in 1965.
            Today the site has a good road, a parking lot, a comfortable restaurant which is well known among locals and tourists.
            Thousands of visitors come here to enjoy the park like valley with the springs and the irrigation canals.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            So now finally to the ten attractions.
            The first seven are the karst springs, which are definitely worth a look.
            And there is the good food at the restaurant, which we already mentioned.
            Number 9 is the dam and the waterfall.
            But number 10 is the reason why we classified the site as artificial structure.
            It is a tunnel which connects the two tributaries, os the water from both is collected in the reservoir for irrigation.
            This tunnel was built by Italian constructors and local workers and was completed in 1931.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tunnel is 150 m long, and a walk though takes about 5 to 10 minutes.
            It is big enough to walk through upright, but there is always water flowing and there is no light.
            So bring flip-flops or water-resistant shoes and a lamp.
            The tunnel is not gated and the visit is free.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            And there is the lake, which is 200 m long, 10 to 50 m wide, and 1 t0 8 m deep.
            The water is used for irrigation until today.
            This is the only place in Rhodes where visitors can enjoy a swim in fresh water.
        </p>
