        <h2>History</h2>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Σπήλαιο Εκκλησάκι Αγίου Νικολάου</b> (Spílaio Ekklisáki Agíou Nikoláou, Cave Church of Saint Nicholas) is located on the Acropolis of Rhodos, but is not connected with the Antique archaeological remains.
            However, there are speculations that the cavern was originally a part of the Nymphaeum on the other side of the road and was much later transformed into a church.
            If so, there are no remains which would allow proving this, so it is just speculation.
            The soft rock allows digging caves rather easily, and so it is also possible that this cave was actually dug for any other purpose.
            But it existed before the church.
            Its even possible that the cave is at least partly natural.
            The rock here is Quaternary sedimentary rock which obviously includes the formation of tufa by limestone rich spring water.
            So it's possible that there were small natural tufa caves which were widened.
            The site was as far as we know never geologically examined.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The acropolis is mostly destroyed, only some basements and foundations remain.
            The whole hill was used until 1947 by the farmers as an auxiliary pasture, the small cave was a barn for the livestock.
            The church is based on a mystical discovery in this year, the icon of St. <b class="smallCaps">Nicholas</b> was found inside the cavern.
            As a result, the place of the mystical discovery was converted into a church, where the icon is now presented, and of course the church was dedicated to St. <b class="smallCaps">Nicholas</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The small cave church is hard to find.
            It is not visible from the road across the acropolis, which is surrounded by flat fields.
            There is a sign for the Nymphaeum on the other side of the road and a small gravel car park, probably big enough for 10 cars.
            And there is a stone staircase leading downhill through an iron archway with a cross.
            Instead of a sign, there is a small wooden model of a church with some icons on the walls.
            It has a glass window which shows some religious stuff.
            At the end of the stairs is a small paved square with a tufa wall on the right side, which is covered with icons and other religious symbols, crucifixes, and even some plants.
            There is a bell to signal the beginning of the service.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The door in this rock face leads to the cave church.
            Inside is a room with an irregular form, the walls are not plain and not rectangular, the cave looks actually almost natural.
            The walls are covered with icons of saints, and there are all the necessary items of a Greek Orthodox church.
            On top of the cave the floor was covered with concrete, we guess as a sort of roof which collects rainwater.
            Water seeping through the tuff would destroy the beautiful icons.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave church is under the responsibility of the ecclesiastical committee of the parish church of St. John of Rhodes.
            It is administered by the Ministry of Culture and Sports.
        </p>
