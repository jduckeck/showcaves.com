        <div class="foreignText">

            <p>
                Returning from a holiday I found myself in Crete.
                I only had a day to spare so I called in at the tourist office and the man
                recommended a visit the cave of Melidoni, near Perama.
                He even gave me a letter of introduction addressed to his brother who owned a
                garage in Perama, and who he assured me would help me find the cave.
                I duly caught a bus and after a 1:45 hour drive through some wonderful limestone
                country with lots of caves, and high, barren mountains, I arrived at Perama,
                and got off.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                As I could not even read the name of the man I wanted, I gave the letter to the
                first person I came across, and he took me to a nearby garage.
                Here I was made most welcome and introduced to my guide,
                <b class="smallCaps">Ivanulos Nicholau Manilitzia</b>.
                He had just had an accident in the garage and lost 2 fingers, but despite this
                we both climbed into his modern car, and soon arrived at the village of
                Melidoni.
                This is well off the beaten tourist track and after Ivanulos had shown me off
                to his friends, we continued on through the village, and turned down a track
                marked &rdquo;Spileon&bdquo;.
                This lead to a small church or chapel, painted white, which I had seen from
                below.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Behind the chapel was the cave in a depression like a quarry.
                I got some candles from the church as Ivanulos said my torch was not good
                enough.
                There are several ways into the cave, the main entrance and a shaft being the
                most obvious.
                We went in by the main entrance, a hole about 5 ft high and 6 ft wide, that
                seemed to have been excavated from a much smaller entrance.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                This led down a cone of loose debris for about 100 feet vertically into a huge
                chamber.
                The first thing that struck me was a large tomb in the centre, with a fading
                wreath on it.
                Ivanulos told me what it was all about.
                The tomb was in memory of 300 people who were killed or suffocated by the
                Turks in 1823 during the war between Greece and Turkey.
                At first I could not believe his story, however, the whole area seemed to have
                been a hotbed of partisan activity for some time.
                During the second world war the cave was used as a hiding place and a second,
                smaller memorial had also been erected in the cave in memory of those killed
                by the Germans as reprisals.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                We then went on a tour of the cave.
                The main chamber contained, besides the tomb, many large formations, including
                in one corner a column about 15 feet round and 30 feet high.
                A small climb in one corner brought us into a chamber about 5 feet high and
                10 feet in diameter, where several men had their throats cut by the Turks.
                We then went on down further into the cave.
                A short climb down about 10 feet brought us into another chamber, even larger
                than the first, filled with magnificent formations covered with a fine black
                soot.
                This was where the women and children had been hiding when the Turks threw down
                burning brushwood into the cave from the entrance shaft and suffocated them.
                Some of the formations had small tips of white calcite, where new formation was
                growing on top of the sooty stal.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Throughout the cave we could hear the chattering of many bats, and eventually
                managed to capture one, which Ivanulos insisted in wrapping in his handkerchief
                so that we could examine it in daylight.
                Our exploration had been slow, and almost 2 hours had elapsed since we had
                entered the cave, so with our candles burning low, I declined a visit to the
                lower series and we wended our way out.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Needless to say I was pretty filthy, and dressed in the only clothes I had
                taken to the island, I once again took advantage of the hospitality of the
                church and washed in its well.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                I walked back to Perama down a dry waterworn stream bed, and caught the
                8.00 pm bus back to Iraklion.
                The spontaneous generosity and kindness of the people of Crete, not least
                Ivanulos made this a trip to remember and it is easy to see why people return
                time and time again to this little bit of karstic paradise in the Aegean.
            </p>

            The <b>Melidoni Cave</b> was used for cult worship during the Neolithic, Minoan and Archaic periods.
        </p>


        <div class="foreignText">

            <p>
                The archaeological finds from the early Neolithic to the Roman Period which
                have been found in this cave are in the Museum of Rethymon.
                The cave is the mythical home of <b>Talos</b> - the giant bronze protector
                of Crete.
                There is the legend that says Medea - the sorceress - took away his protective
                thorn and he bled to death.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Melidoni Cave was the site of a sanctuary dedicated to Hermes Talaios during
                the Classical Greek Period.
                There is a plaque with an inscription which gives evidence to this fact.
