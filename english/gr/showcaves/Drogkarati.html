        <p>
            <b>Drogkarati Cave</b> got its current shape during a heavy earthquake, when a large part of the cave collapsed.
            One end collapsed completely and produced a huge doline at the surface, which provided access to the rest of the cave.
            The middle part collapsed partly and so this part has a much higher floor today, consisting of debris, including huge blocks of limestone.
            The other end of the cave was damaged only a little.
            Some broken stalagmites maybe a result of this earthquake.
            When the earthquake happened is not clear, although it happened in historic times.
            Three different cave descriptions, all printed by the same cave administration, talk of 300, 400, and 900 years respective.
            As unclear as this date is the identity or name of the cave discoverer.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The story about locals discovering the cave right after the earthquake sounds rather logical, but is just a legend.
            And there are some details inside the cave which do not fit into this story.
            Most probably there was originally a single huge cavern, some 100 m long, divided into two parts by huge blocks of debris which fell from the ceiling during thousands of years, and now forms a balcony.
            This debris is not the result of a recent earthquake, as huge stalagmites have grown on the blocks, which takes several thousand years.
            The side where today the doline is located probably collapsed over millennia, incasion making the ceiling thinner and thinner until it finally collapsed.
            During this process, the ceiling and the floor moved upwards by rocks falling to the floor.
            When the cave roof actually collapsed is impossible to determine, there are no speleothems on this debris,
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The visitor enters the cave through the natural entrance.
            A nice path with many steps leads down the slope of the doline, leading in numerous U-turns to the cave entrance.
            Above the entrance, some fences protect the visitors from rocks, which may probably fall from the cliff above.
            The doline is full of trees and shrubs, so the path is shady.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            When the visitor enters the first hall, the stairs end.
            The path divides into two, and the visitor has to decide which one he takes.
            It does not really matter, as it is a round trip, but most of the people go down on the right side, so we will describe it this way.
            The first hall has a more or less flat floor, which is most likely a result of human <i>"improvements"</i>.
            The <b>Balcony</b>, which is reached by a short branch of the path at the end of the hall, is definitely man made.
            Several huge stalagmites were used to make a sort of fence at the rim.
            Beyond lies the <b>Chamber of Exaltation</b>, named so because of its wonderful acoustics.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Now we follow the path down into the main chamber, which uses a sort of side passage, separated from the rest of the cave mostly by stalagmites and stalactites.
            Unfortunately, most of the speleothems are destroyed.
            Only stubs remain, telling a story of vandalism.
            Of course, several stalactites were destroyed by the frequent earthquakes.
            But the cave was freely accessible for a long time, and many people went in to gather a <b>souvenir</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At a depth of 60 m below ground, we reach the floor of the <b>Chamber of Exaltation</b>, also called <b>Concert Room</b>.
            It is a semicircular, level floored hall, about 40x30 m and 15 m high.
            It is used for concerts for an audience of up to 500 people.
            The balcony with the stalagmites is used to seat officials and is thus named the <b>Royal Balcony</b>.
            The performers play from a slightly raised recess in the wall flanked by stalagmites.
            The floor of this hall is obviously intensively altered by man, the level floor was made artificial.
            This left no single stalagmite inside the hall, the floor of the hall is made of grit which is surrounded on a paved path.
            After surrounding the hall, the path arrives at the other side of the descent, and another path leads up into the entrance hall, again with a short branch to another balcony.
            Then we return through the doline back to the surface.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Like so many Greek caves, this cave is illuminated only by yellow lamps, making the cave look dark and a little <i>sick</i>.
            Most photographs on this page do not show this, as they were mostly made with flash.
            On the other hand, the cave is visited on a self-guided tour, which should give anyone enough time, photography is allowed, and the fee is admissible.
            All in all, the visit was enjoyable.
        </p>
