        <p>
            <b>Drogkarati Cave</b> became its actual shape during a heavy earthquake, when
            a large part of the cave collapsed.
            One end collapsed completely and produced a huge doline at the surface, which
            provided access to the rest of the cave.
            The middle part collapsed partly and so this part has a much higher floor today,
            consisting of debris, including huge blocks of limestone.
            The other end of the cave was damaged only a little.
            Some broken stalagmites maybe a result of this earthquake.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            When the earthquake happened is not clear.
            Three different cave descriptions, all printed by the same cave administration,
            talk of 300, 400, and 900 years respective.
            As unclear as this date is the identity or name of the cave discoverer.
            The story about locals discovering the cave right after the earthquake sounds
            rather logical, but is just a guess.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Most probably there was originally a single huge cavern, some 100m long,
            divided into two parts by huge blocks of debris which fell from the ceiling
            during thousands of years, and now forms a balcony.
            This debris is not the result of a recent earthquake, as huge stalagmites
            have grown on the blocks, which takes several thousand years.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The visitor enters the cave through the natural entrance.
            A nice path with many steps leads down the slope of the doline, leading in
            numerous u-turns to the cave entrance.
            Above the entrance some fences protect the visitors from rocks, which may
            probably fall from the cliff above.
            The doline is full of trees and shrubs, so the path is shady.
        </p>

        <table class="leftImg" width="260">
            <tr>
                <td><a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../../images/Big/D056-0542.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../../images/D056-0542.jpg" width="250" height="188"></a></td>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <p class="indentedText">
            When the visitor enters the first hall, the stairs end.
            The path divides into two, and the visitor has to decide which one he takes.
            It does not really matter, as it is a round trip, but most of the people go
            down at the right side, so we will describe it this way.
            The first hall has a more or less flat floor, which is most likely a result
            of human <i>improvements</i>.
            The <b>Balcony</b>, which is reached by a short branch of the path at the end
            of the hall, is definitely man made.
            Several huge stalagmites used to make a sort of fence at the rim.
            Beyond lies the <b>Chamber of Exaltation</b>, named so because of its wonderful
            acoustics.
        </p>

        <table class="rightImg" width="260">
            <tr>
                <td><a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../../images/Big/D056-0563.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../../images/D056-0563.jpg" width="250" height="188"></a></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="imgCaption"><b>Image:</b> the way back up.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Now we follow the path down into the main chamber, which uses a sort of side
            passage, separated from the rest of the cave mostly by stalagmites and
            stalactites.
            Unfortunately most of the speleothems are destroyed.
            Only stubs remain, telling a story of vandalism.
            Of course, several stalactites were destroyed by the frequent earthquakes.
            But the cave was freely accessible for a long time and many people went in to
            gather a <b>souvenir</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At a depth of 60m below ground, we reach the floor of the <b>Chamber of
            Exaltation</b>, also called <b>Concert Room</b>.
            It is a semi-circular, level floored hall, about 40x30m and 15m high.
            It is used for concerts for an audience of up to 500 people.
            The balcony with the stalagmites is used to seat officials and is thus named
            the <b>Royal Balcony</b>.
            The performers play from a slightly raised recess in the wall flanked by
            stalagmites.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The floor of this hall is obviously intensively altered by man, the level
            floor made artificial.
            This left no single speleothem inside the hall, which is surrounded on a paved
            path.
            The floor of the hall is made of grit.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            After surrounding the hall the path arrives at the other side of the descent,
            and another path leads up into the entrance hall, again with a short branch to
            another balcony.
            Then we return through the doline back to the surface.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Like so many Greek caves, this cave is illuminated only by yellow lamps, making
            the cave look dark and a little <i>sick</i>.
            The photographs on this page do not show this, as they were mostly made with
            flash.
            On the other hand the cave is visited on a self guided tour, which should give
            anyone enough time, photography is allowed, and the fee is admissibly.
            All in all the visit was enjoyable.
