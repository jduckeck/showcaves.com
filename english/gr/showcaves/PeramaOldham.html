            <p>
                Our perambulations took us next to Perama Cave, near Ioannina, the most
                widely visited show cave in Greece. We had expected to have to fight our
                way through all the tourists, but we must have picked a quiet day or
                time, because the visitors were far outnumbered by the shopkeepers, the
                whole town seemingly having been turned over to selling souvenirs.
                Goodness knows how they do cope when a lot of people turned up, parking
                is very limited. The cave was discovered by chance in 1941 when the
                locals were looking for somewhere to shelter from the bombardment. When
                we went out on the nearby lake later, we could see that the cave is
                situated in an isolated limestone knoll, the whole of which was
                honeycombed with caves.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Arriving at the entrance we were given a leaflet in English and noted
                that the temperature in the cave was 17 °C, there were 163 steps leading
                out of the second entrance, and the tour took 45 minutes.
            </p>

                After a short wait the guide appeared and in the company of about 15
                other visitors we embarked on what can only be described as a brisk trot
                through the cave. „Don't you think we're ever going to stop?” Christina
                asked as we raced up and down steps, across chasms on bridges with no
                sides and down steep slopes. The leaflet described the numbered
                stalactites on the tour, the commentary being in Greek only. Our
                commentary went something like this:
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Christina: „That was number 8, the next one we are coming to should be
                The Leaning Tower of Pisa”.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Me: „Well we've missed it, this one's number 10”.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                I was quite glad there was a small child in the party, because at least
                we could get behind him and pretend that it was his slowness on the
                stairs that was holding us up rather than our unfit state after so much
                lack of exercise.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                When we did stop we could appreciated what a magnificent cave this is,
                huge chambers and massive formations some of which have been welded into
                grotesque shapes through the action of old earthquakes and subsequent
                calcification. Part way up the 163 steps leading to the exit is a
                memorial to <b class="smallCaps">Ion Petrocheilou</b>, the founder of
                Greek Speleology. We
                thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Perama, which we felt could well be a
                contender for the title „The fastest Show Cave in Europe”.
