            <p>
                A visit to the Diktaeon Cave, reputedly the birthplace of Zeus, must be
                on every tourist itinerary. No holiday in Crete would be complete
                without this experience, but nothing in any of the tourist guides or even
                travel books on the island prepared me for the descent.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                In addition to the many, and expensive, coach tours which are on offer,
                the bus from Heraklion, capitol of the island, conveys the visitor
                cheaply and very comfortably on the spectacular ascent into the
                mountains, the one hundred mile [160 km] round trip costing about &pound;3.00.
                At about 4,000 ft [1219 m] the Lassithi plateau is reached and
                circumnavigated, with its neat plots of fruit and vegetables, each
                surrounded with apple and olive tree, and irrigated by water drawn up by
                windmill. These windmills, said to be 10,000 in all, are metal gantries
                about 20 ft [6 m] high with a dozen [12] small white sails which can be
                neatly furled around the spokes of the sail when not in use, and it is
                quite a sight as the bus tops the pass to see this absolutely flat plain,
                ringed by mountains, stretching away for about seven miles [11 km], and
                all these white sails wildly whirling.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                At the far side of the plateau the new road peters out just beyond the
                village of Psychron above which the cave is situated. A sign says
                &rdquo;Diktaeon Cave 2 km&bdquo; but omits to point out that the direction is
                vertical! A stony track zig zags from the little cluster of tavernas and
                souvenir shops, in amongst the ubiquitous olive trees, and for the weak
                or foolhardy donkeys may be hired - rather after the style of Clovelly!
                The ascent continues until at
                about 1,000 ft [304 m] above Psychron the visitor arrives on a wide shelf
                with spectacular views back over the plateau and forward into the rugged
                mountain with only sparse vegetation at this height. A man sits under an
                olive tree with a table at his side and from him you buy a ticket for 50
                drachma (about 30 p). He asked me if I had a lamp, and when I said no,
                he said I must buy a candle, which I did for 25 dr. There were no other
                visitors at the time, and I could see no sign of a cave but he waved his
                hand at the hillside just above and on following a small path towards the
                hill, there appeared the gaping entrance to the cave about 30 - 40 ft
                high [10 m].
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                As no details or warning about the cave had been given, I assumed that
                one would enter a large, flat floored cavern and thus was totally
                unprepared for the deep, almost sheer hole which appeared at my feet
                [m?]. Far below me, about 800 ft [243 m] down in fact, I could just make
                out the flicker of candles carried by some other visitors. Between us a
                black void! A candle stuck into a nearby rock reminded me that I must
                light my own, and begin to search for a way down.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                As my eyes became accustomed to the darkness, I could just make out a
                handrail to the left and dimly perceived that steep steps had been cut
                into the rock. As they shone with a wet sheen it was very cautiously
                that I began to descend. Candle light was initially almost totally
                useless but gradually I overcame my fear of being precipitated into the
                blackness below and began to make out the stalactite formations in the
                roof above, and by the time I reached the bottom, a combination of
                candlelight and the dim light shafting down from the entrance above, was
                sufficient to reveal some magnificent examples of stalagmites and
                stalactites, with small pools and a little overflow trickle which
                disappeared somewhere into the rock. At various levels small opening
                could be seen but it was impossible to tell whether these led anywhere,
                and nowhere was I able to discover whether it is possible to explore this
                cave further.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Although in summer one must pay to visit the cave, I could observe no
                means of shutting off the cave during other times, and I presume visitors
                come here at all times of the year. I reflected on my descent how in
                Britain such a visit would have been impossible without proper lighting
                and all kinds of safety regulations, which would have spoilt the rather
                more adventurous nature of the expedition for those who, like myself do
                not venture far underground.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                It was pleasantly cool and quiet in the cave, the small groups of
                visitors who were ascending and descending seeming to make little noise
                and their candles hardly affected the lighting level, and it was rather
                reluctantly I began the steep but decidedly more secure ascent to the hot
                dry landscape outside. It was easy to see how myths and legends would
                arise from such a cave. Before the building of the new road into the
                mountains, access for thousands of years had been difficult and the
                mountains would have appeared more mysterious and inaccessible. Where
                better for Zeus to have been born?
            </p>
