        <h2>History</h2>

        <div class="foreignText">

            <p>
                The cave has been used as a habitation site since Neolithic times.
                A series of excavations shows seasonal inhabitation during the Early Minoan
                Period and random use during the Roman Period.
                Finally, during the Turkish Occupation the cave was again used as a refuge.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                There is a legend attached to the cave of a little girl who's curiosity got the
                better of her.
                She found a crack in the rocks and crawled inside.
                Fascinated by what she found she wandered for days underground looking for the
                way out.
                Her family searched for days looking for her, but alas when they found her she
                was dead.
                She had such a sweet smile on her face that the villagers said she had been
                abducted by fairies.

                            A roomy entrance chamber seems to end with a barrier of stalactite columns, but
                            a narrow passage leads into a second chamber called &rdquo;The Ante-Chamber of
                            the Harmonium&bdquo;, this, like the following chambers, is all lavishly
                            decorated with massive spelothems.
                            Frequently massive columns appear to block the passage, but each time a narrow
                            opening gives access to yet another chamber, in fact fourteen chambers in total,
                            all with fanciful names from Greek mythology and nothing to do with the
                            speleogenisis of the cave.
                            The tour takes the shape of three figures of eight in the plan view.
                            The path way criss crosses from one wall of the cave to the other before doing
                            an about turn to exit via the entrance.

            <b>Spilaio Sphentoni</b> is often called the most interesting cave of Crete.
            It is definitely one of the best developed.
            Increasing numbers of visitors made the renovation of the entrance area and
            parts of the cave installation necessary.
            The path to the cave entrance has been widened and allows easy access and
            because of its view it is a nice spot to wait for the next tour.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is home to numerous troglobionts, like snails and insects.
            Those small animals are colourless and blind.
            There are also numerous cave visitors like bats.
            There favourite spots are easy to see: the bat guano colours the floor in black.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There is a legend how the cave got its name.
            It is called <b>Sfentoni's Hole</b> after a man named <b
                class="smallCaps">Sfentonis</b>.
            He was a guerilla (greek: <i>hainis</i>) from Sfakia who had found refuge in the
            cave.
            On day he was discovered by a young man while cooking at the cave entrance.
            The man asked for something to eat.
            Sfentoni killed him as he feared the man might give him away.
            The legend tells he kicked him with his <b>stivani</b>, the traditional Cretan
            boot, so hard that he killed him.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Another legend tells about a beautiful fairy who used to hide in the cave and a
            sheperd.
            At a specific time of the day the fairy came out of the cave to drink some water
            at a neighbouring spring.
            A shepherd had seen her many times, but when he approached she always ran away
            into the cave.
            So one day he used his slingshot to catch her, but although she was hurt and
            blooding, she ran away.
            One version of the story tells she managed to escape but left a bloody
            handkerchief.
            Another version tells he approached the injured fairy, and attempted to kiss
            her.
            The fairy promised to give him a magic reel of silk, which would never come to
            an end, if he let her go.
            But the shepherd could not resist kissing her.
            So the fairy put "the curse of trembling hands" on him and his whole family.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The legend of the little girl as told above by Tony has a certain background.
            Some decades ago the skeleton of a small child was found at the end of the cave.
            The bones were covered by flowstone, which indicates a rather high age.
            There is nothing known how this child came into the cave.
            Probably it was lost, or it was a burial.
        </p>
