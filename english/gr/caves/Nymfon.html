        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The name <b>Σπήλαιο Νυμφών</b> (Spílaio Nymfón, Cave of the Nymphs) comes from the ancient Greek mythology, it was a place of worship of the Nymphs.
            It is often written <b>Σπήλαιο του Νυμφών</b> (Spílaio tou Nymfón), which is the correct writing, but on the sign at the cave entrance it is written without the "tou".
            This cave is also called <b>Μαρμαροσπηλιά</b> (Marmarospilia, Marble Cave).
        </p>

        <p class="foreign">
            "In what ship, my dear father, did your crew bring you to Ithaca? Of what nation did they declare themselves to be - for you cannot have come by land?"
            <br>
            "I will tell you the truth, my son", replied Ulysses. "It was the Phaeacians
            who brought me here. They are great sailors, and are in the habit of giving
            escorts to anyone who reaches their coasts. They took me over the sea while I
            was fast asleep, and landed me in Ithaca, after giving me many presents in
            bronze, gold, and raiment. These things by heaven's mercy are lying concealed
            in a cave, and I am now come here on the suggestion of Minerva that we may
            consult about killing our enemies. First, therefore, give me a list of the
            suitors, with their number, that I may learn who, and how many, they are. I can
            then turn the matter over in my mind, and see whether we two can fight the
            whole body of them ourselves, or whether we must find others to help us."

        <p>
            It is said, that this was the place where the <b>Phaeacians</b> left the sleeping <b>Odysseus</b> and the gifts they gave him, when they brought him back to Ithaca, ten years after the end of the Troyan War.
            One of the reasons is the description of the Cave of the Nymphs in the Odyssey in book 13.

            and at the head of the harbor is a slender-leaved olive<br>
            and near by it a lovely and murky cave<br>
            sacred to the nymphs called Naiads.<br>
            Within are kraters and amphoras<br>
            of stone, where bees lay up stores of honey.<br>
            Inside, too, are massive stone looms and there the nymphs<br>
            weave sea-purple cloth, a wonder to see.<br>
            The water flows unceasingly. The cave has two gates,<br>
            the one from the north, a path for men to descend,<br>
            while the other, toward the south, is divine. Men do not<br>
            enter by this one, but it is rather a path for immortals.<br>

        <p class="">
            The cave actually has two entrances.
            The one in the north is for man, as it is narrow and easy to enter.
            The one in the south is for gods, as it is an opening in the ceiling, and so the people were not able to use it during the Bronze Age, only the gods were able to fly through.
            However, it this is the only detail which fits, that's not very convincing.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But one fact is rather curious: Marmarospilia is 180 m above sea level, and it is rather strenuous to carry all the goods so far.
            A cave closer to the shore would be a better bet.
            Finds of twelve tripods in

            similar to those Odysseus is supposed to have received from the Phaeacians, make this cave a much better bet.

                This cave is about 2.5 km up a rough but navigable road, signposted from
                the brow of the hill above Dhéxa beach in the Bay of Vathi. The claim
                that this cave is mentioned in Homer's Odyssey (XII, 96) where the
                returning Odysseus concealed the gifts given to him by King Alcinous, is
                enhanced by the proximity of Dhéxa beach, although there is some evidence
                that the "true" cave was located just above the beach and was
                accidentally destroyed by quarrying some years ago.

                A narrow entrance leads into a level floored chamber 7 m wide by 4 m deep
                and 3 m high. To the left there is a balcony overlooking a large chamber
                which is 5 m lower down. This is The Great Chamber, 14 m long, 10 m wide
                and 10 m high containing some sooty coloured speleothems. The chamber is
                dimly lit by a small karst window in the ceiling, giving a very ghostly
                effect. A small side passage for 5 m before closing down. A powerful
                torch is needed.

            The cave was listed on <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span> under the name Marble Cave, its second name, and it was listed as a show cave, which it is not.
            To establish, if there actually was a cult of nymphs in the cave archaeological excavations by the Athens Archaeological Society of The Ministry Of Culture were made 1998-2002.
            The finds are figurines of the nymphs and their companion <b class="smallCaps">Panos</b>.
            They also discovered a second chamber, the same size as the first but in a deeper level.
            The roof was collapsed, probably during various earthquakes, and between 2 and 3 m of debris covered the archaeolgicl remains and protected them
            The archaeologists installea a generator-powered lift, which reached a depth of 21 m, to lift the rocks out of the cave.
            In total, the excavation reached a depth of 36 m.
            When it ended, the lower part was closed and only the upper chamber was open to the public.

        <p class="indentedText">
            There are numerous show caves in Greece which have no light and poor trails, and this cave actually has a gate, which is a sign for a show cave.
            Nevertheless, there is actually no development except what the archaeologists built to support their excavations.
            Generally, the cave is freely accessible, but for some reason it was closed some time ago, and it is unknown if and when it will be reopened.
            However, at the moment it is definitely closed.
            Also, this cave is mostly of archaeological interest, so it is more interesting to visit the findings in the museum.
            They can be seen in the <b>Αρχαιολογικό Μουσείο Ιθάκης</b> (Archaeological Museum of Ithaca) in Vathi.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave was mentioned by <b class="smallCaps">Anna Petroheilou</b> in her book <b>The Greek Caves</b>.
            Many pages on the web are based on her description, including ours, which is not very good because the book is not very detailed and more than 40 years old.
            It seems there is actually no recent information, so we guess the cave is closed for some time.
