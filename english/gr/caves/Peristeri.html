        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Σπήλαιο Περιστεριών</b> (Spilaio Peristeri, Dovecot) is a small cave located at the Steno-Vathy road on the west coast of Methana.
            Methana is an island, or probably a peninsula as it is connected to mainland Attica by a landbridge.
            When reaching the island, just keep left, the cave is only 1.8 km from the landbridge.
            There is a small wooden sign at the road.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The locals thought that the cave was haunted and that fairies and evil spirits lived here.
            As a result, it's been avoided since antiquity.
            But in the mid-20th century, <b class="smallCaps">Vangelis Lazarou</b> from Taktikoupolis finally entered the portal and discovered the cave behind.
            Its unclear how much he actually visited, as most of the cave is only accessible after crossing a cave lake.
            The cave was first explored and mapped by the Greek speleologist <b class="smallCaps">Anna Petrochilou</b> in the 1970s, who surveyed 240 m and an area of 4000 m².
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The island is karstified limestone with a volcano in the center.
            Limestone is always of economic interest, and as much of the island is volcanic, the limestone at the cave was planned for quarrying.
            During the Greek military dictatorship, the cement works of the Iraklis company expanded on the Methanas limestone massif.
            They quarried Thynni Bay and its archaeological remains were completely destroyed.
            When <b class="smallCaps">Anna Petrochilou</b> explored the cave she was made aware of those plans.
            Some local people wanted to protect the cave from destruction, and they protested, so the quarrying was delayed.
            The danger ended finally in 1974 with the fall of the military dictatorship, and the subsequent closure of the plant on Methana.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The book of <b class="smallCaps">Anna Petrochilou</b> about Greek caves contains a description and a map of the cave.
            The map also contains a trail of the show cave development, as she actually intended the book to be a list of future show caves.
            She planned the development and published the cave how it could be a show cave.
            In several cases this worked quite well, but this cave was actually never developed as a show cave.
            The main reason is probably that it is too far from Athens and from tourist hotspots.
            Or simply that there never was anyone who was willing to pay for the development.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave has a huge main passage which is 240 m long.
            The entrance portal was subject to frost weathering, the rocks from the ceiling were loosened and fell down, as a result the entrance moved upwards and the cave is entered across a pile of debris.
            Once down the entrance slope, a cave lake is reached, which must be crossed by swimming or by boat, and you arrive at a small rock island.
            After crossing the next lake which is at a narrow section of the passage, the <b>Penguin Hall</b> is reached.
            Here the floor is mostly dry, and there are numerous stalactites and stalagmites.
            The cave ends at the third lake, called <b>Door of Hades</b>, which is narrow and only 11 m long.
            According to lore, there is a stalagmite which resembles a pigeon and gave the cave its name, others say its the reason why the hall is called <b>Penguin Hall</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Another cave on the western coast of the island is the <b>Heracles Cave</b> near Steno.
            During the construction of the road Steno-Vathy in 1995, the entrance was blocked with boulders.
            Its unclear if this was an accident or if it was intentional.
            But while this cave is inaccessible at the moment, it was fortunately not destroyed.
        </p>
