        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Σπήλαιο Περιστεριών</b> (Spilaio Peristeri, Dovecot) is a small cave located at the Steno-Vathy road on the west coast of Methana.
            Methana is an island, or probably a peninsula as it is connected to mainland Attica by a landbridge.
            When reaching the island, just keep left, the cave is only 1.8 km from the landbridge.
            There is a small wooden sign at the road.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The locals thought that the cave was haunted and that fairies and evil spirits lived here.
            So the originally called it <b>Σπήλαιο τις νεράϊδες</b> (Cave of the Fairies)
            As a result, it's been avoided since antiquity.
            Before the road was built, there was a path which the inhabitants of the Megalohorios area used to go to the plain of Troizenia.
            They made sure to pass the cave before sunset on their way back.
            A psychic advised the people to nail fairies down with three nails, and so three nails were hammered in above the entrance.
            From then on the cave was called <b>Γκόζντιζα</b> (Gozdiza, Nails).
            But there are other legends, for example, that the cave was used as a shelter by the shepherds of the area.
            Some say that the locals fished in the lake for horseshoe crabs.
            And there is the story that a wooden plough that got lost in the area of Throni was found inside the cave.
            As a result, many locals believe that the cave extends all the way below the Throni plateau.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But in 1972, <b class="smallCaps">Efangelos V. Lazarou</b> from Taktikoupolis finally entered the portal and discovered the cave behind.
            Its unclear how much he actually visited, as most of the cave is only accessible after crossing a cave lake.
            He reported the cave to the Ephorate of Antiquities, but they told him to inform the newly founded Greek Speleological Society instead.
            The cave was first explored and mapped by the Greek speleologists <b class="smallCaps">Ilias Gouvelou</b> und <b class="smallCaps">Georgios Dilaras</b> in February 1974, who surveyed 240 m.
            An article about the cave was published by <b class="smallCaps">Anna Petrocheilou</b> in the same year.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The island is karstified limestone with a volcano in the center.
            Limestone is always of economic interest, and as much of the island is volcanic, the limestone at the cave was planned for quarrying.
            During the Greek military dictatorship, the cement works of the Iraklis company expanded on the Methanas limestone massif.
            They quarried at Thynni Bay and its archaeological remains were completely destroyed.
            On 13-JAN-1973, <b class="smallCaps">Spyros Papaioannou</b>, <b class="smallCaps">Stavros Maltezos</b>, <b class="smallCaps">Dimitris Triantafyllou</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Vassilis Triantafyllou</b> explored the cave, probably because they feard it would be gone quite soon.
            Later that year, the entrance and the first chamber of the cave were actually blown up by the company.
            Some local people and <b class="smallCaps">Efangelos V. Lazarou</b> wanted to protect the cave from destruction, and they protested numerous times.
            Finally, on 08-JAN-1974, <b class="smallCaps">Efangelos V. Lazarou</b> succeeded to convince the authorities of the importance of the cave and the quarrying was stopped.
            The danger ended finally in 1974 with the fall of the military dictatorship, and the subsequent closure of the plant on Methana.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            We have no info of further exploration, either because there were no explorations or probably because they were published in Greek.
            Also, there is no known underwater exploration until 26-SEP-2020.
            Cave divers of Addicted2h2o explored the cave, discovered two passages to the left and right in the first lake.
            Both are unexplored leads, the left produces a large quantity of water.
            It is unknown if this is fresh or seawater, but there is definitely both in the cave lake, as they discovered a <b>halocline</b> in the first lake.
            They also discovered an underwater side branch leading to an underwater chamber with speleothems.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The book of <b class="smallCaps">Anna Petrochilou</b> about Greek caves contains a description and a map of the cave.
            The map also contains a trail of the show cave development, as she actually intended the book to be a list of future show caves.
            She planned the development and published the cave how it could be a show cave.
            In several cases this worked quite well, but this cave was actually never developed as a show cave.
            The main reason is probably that it is too far from Athens and from tourist hotspots.
            Or simply that there never was anyone who was willing to pay for the development.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave has a huge main passage which is 240 m long.
            The entrance is 30 m above the road, and it is necessary to climb the rocks to reach the entrance of the cave.
            The entrance is at the top of the pile of debris.
            Once down the entrance slope, a cave lake is reached, which must be crossed by swimming or by boat, and you arrive at a small rock island.
            After crossing the next lake which is at a narrow section of the passage, the <b>Penguin Hall</b> is reached.
            Here the floor is mostly dry, and there are numerous stalactites and stalagmites.
            The cave ends at the third lake, called <b>Door of Hades</b>, which is narrow and only 11 m long.
            According to lore, there is a stalagmite which resembles a pigeon and gave the cave its name, others say it's the reason why the hall is called <b>Penguin Hall</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            We have listed this cave rather recently, despite the chapter in <b class="smallCaps">Anna Petrochilou</b>'s book it was undeveloped and rarely visited.
            As a result of the new road, the sign to the cave, and the warning sign by the "Arsinoi" association which warns about the dangers of the cave, it actually became more popular.
            We would not have listed it though, as the section which may be entered easily is pretty short and ends at the first lake.
            Also, the clay in the entrance section makes this section slippery and very dangerous.
            The only way to actually visit this cave is cave trekking, you need the appropriate gear, helmet, waterproof lamps, and we strongly recommend inflatable boats.
            As far as we know, the lakes are up to 2.5 m deep, so wading will not work.
            If you prefer swimming, dry clothes, towels asf are advisable too.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Another cave on the western coast of the island is the <b>Heracles Cave</b> near Steno.
            During the construction of the road Steno-Vathy in 1995, the entrance was blocked with boulders.
            Its unclear if this was an accident or if it was intentional.
            But while this cave is inaccessible at the moment, it was fortunately not destroyed.
        </p>
