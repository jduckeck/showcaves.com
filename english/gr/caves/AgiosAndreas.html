        <h2>History</h2>

        <br class="clear">


        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Άγιος Ανδρέας ο Ερημίτης</b> (Saint Andrew the Hermit) is the name of the cave church, while the cave behind is named <b>Σπήλαιο Αγίου Ανδρέα</b> (Cave of Agios Andreas), or sometimes <b>Σπήλαιο Οσίου Ανδρέα Ερημίτη</b> (Cave of Saint Andreas Hermit).
            This is a rather long cave with a small chapel inside, which is dedicated to Saint <b class="smallCaps">Andrew</b>.
            Saint <b class="smallCaps">Andreas</b> the Hermit lived in this cave during the reign of the Despot of Epirus, <b class="smallCaps">Michael II Komnenos</b> (*1237-✝1271).
            With his ascetic life he became very famous and had a great influence on the spiritual situation in Western Greece.
            However, there are different versions of the legend.
        </p>

        <p class="foreign">
            Saint <b class="smallCaps">Andreas</b> the Hermit is said to have been born in 1209 in the historic Monodendri in Epiros, where he lived the first years of his life.
            He came from a poor family and from a young age worked hard on his father’s farm.
            When he reached the right age, he married and had children, whom he took care of with great love.
            But when his children were grown up and with the consent of his wife, he decided to live as an ascetic.
            He walked around and finally settled on Kalana Mountain, where he found a cave and made it his abode.
            There he lived the remaining years of his life, praying, keeping vigils and fasting and studying the Holy Bible and lives of saints.
            He fed on tree fruits, wild grasses and plant roots, things he found in the vicinity.
            At first, he had no intercourse with people, only some shepherds with their flock saw him from a distance.
            But the knowledge of his presence spread on the steep mountain, and people walked to the cave to visit him.
            He had wise advise and the number of visitors increased continually until finally crowds of people went to the cave every day to talk with him.
            He finally passed away in 1282.
            His memory is celebrated every 15-MAY, and crowds of people from the region climb up to the cave to honor him.
        </p>

        <p class="foreign">
            He left everything and became a hermit 5 km northeast of Halkiopoulo.
            Here he found a cave and lived in asceticism and trials for the rest of his life for the love of Christ.
            He died in old age, without being noticed by anyone.
            But God did not want this Saint to be unknown.
            As he was departing this life, bright lamps were shining in the heavens above him which could be seen from a great distance.
            These lamps came upon his holy relics.
            Villagers from the area came and found the Saint.
            Among those who came after being informed was Saint <b class="smallCaps">Theodora</b> the Queen of Arta, who had the Saint buried in the cave and built a chapel.
        </p>

        <p class="">
            The cave is located on the northern slopes of Mount Kalana at a height of 1,520 m asl.
            It is reached on a single lane gravel road from Chalkiopoulos and then a hike.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave has a slightly asymmetric portal, which is about 6 m high and 6 m wide.
            The lower half is closed by a wall with a door, which actually looks like the facade of a church.
            Inside the first 12 m of the cave passage are full of items which are common for Greek Orthodox churches: candles, icons, some chairs.
            That’s what they call an <b>iconostasis</b>.
            Then a small chapel follows, with a cross on the top.
            In Greek, it is called an alcove, and it contains a fresco of <b class="smallCaps">Panagia Platytera</b> and four hierarchs, <b class="smallCaps">Agios Basilios</b>, <b class="smallCaps">Chrysostom</b>, <b class="smallCaps">Athanasios</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Epiphanios of Cyprus</b>.
            On the right side, it’s possible to pass this small building, the space behind has an altar and more religious items.
            But after another 10 m the church section ends.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The rest of the cave is a nice, more or less horizontal cave passage with some nice speleothems.
            It is definitely worth a visit, but good shoes and good light are mandatory.
            If you have, bring a helmet with headlamp, that’s more comfortable than a handheld one.
            The cave church has a door, but as far as we know, it is never closed.
            Nevertheless, we recommend visiting during daylight.
            On most days you will be alone, but as it is a church, we nevertheless recommend to dress appropriately.
        </p>
