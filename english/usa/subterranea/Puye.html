        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Puye Cliff Dwellings</b> is one of hundreds of abandoned pueblos in southwestern U.S.A. where the natives lived during the Middle Ages in artificial cave homes.
            The basic explanation is the climate change, which caused a "small ice age" between the 13th and 14th century.
            Colder temperatures changed the rain, and so this area, which is now arid, was semi-arid for some time, and certain life forms like growing corn were possible.
            The pueblo was abandoned in the late 16th century, because the climate had become too dry to allow agriculture any more.
            This is quite long ago, and as there are only archaeological remains and no documents the name is obviously of much younger origin.
            The term <b>pu</b> is a cottontail rabbit and <b>ye</b> means to assemble in the Tewa language, which is spoken by the Tano which live in this area today.
            So the name is interpreted as a <i>place for hunting rabbits</i> or <i>pueblo ruin where the rabbits assemble or meet</i>.
            So it is the modern name of the site, the original name of the pueblo is lost.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The rocks are of pyroclastic origin, block and ash flows.
            The formation is named the <b>Puye Formation</b> after this site.
            The rocks have different properties, the so-called <b>Bandelier Tuff</b> is the softest and was used to carve out dwellings.
            It was actually soft enough for the use of wooden digging tools, which was essential, as the inhabitants were on a Stone Age level.
            The Ancestral Puebloans used stone tools and wooden tools, had agriculture, were sedentary, and had sophisticated ceramics.
            The size and quality of their architecture, multilevel dwellings with planned community spaces is extraordinary for such a Late Stone Age culture.
            It’s the reason why they are named Ancestral Puebloans, <b>pueblo</b> means "village" and "people" in Spanish, the name was given to them by the early Spanish explorers.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Puye Cliff Dwellings are located in Santa Clara Canyon near Española, New Mexico.
            The area is part of the Santa Clara Pueblo Reservation.
            The cliff or escarpment faces south, with a slope of debris at the foot and vertical reddish volcanic rock walls above.
            There are no caves, not even an overhanging cliff which could have been used as a shelter.
            The cliff dwellings were built in front of the vertical wall, the rock was used as rear wall, which gave the buildings a high stability.
            But the soft volcanic tuff was also used to dig rooms into the cliff, which are today high above the visitor in the vertical wall.
            Most of them were accessed from the building in front, some might have had a wooden ladder to the entrance.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The main settlement was obviously not a cave dwelling, there was a pueblo on top of the mesa, above the cliff.
            Several multi-storied dwellings were surrounding a central plaza, the biggest of them had 140 rooms.
            Up to 1500 Pueblo people lived in the area, from hunting and from agriculture.
            About 1580 drought finally forced the villagers to leave.
            They moved to the Rio Grande valley, which offered more water.
            The inhabitants of Santa Clara Pueblo, which is located 16 km to the east, claim to be descendants of the Puye residents.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Puye Cliff Dwellings are owned and operated as a cultural monument by the Pueblo of Santa Clara.
            The site offers various tours, which start at the gift shop.
            The basic tour is called <b>Puye Cliff Dwellings Tour</b> and a tour guide will explain the architecture from the early habitation.
            Everyday life on the Puye Cliff face is explained and the petroglyph’s of the ancient Santa Clara Pueblo people shown.
            The <b>Puye Cliff Dwellings Mesa Top Tour</b> shows the archaeological remain on top of the mesa, the kiva structure, and the main building which once had 140 rooms.
            Multi-storied dwellings were built around a central plaza.
            The site is accessed by a shuttle service.
            The <b>Roadrunner Trail</b> is the most sportive, which actually climbs the cliff face on ancient stone staircases and wooden ladders.
            Some physical fitness, surefootedness, and no fear of height is necessary.
            We also recommend good walking shoes and to bring your own water.
            During the summer months the area is very hot, during winter there may be some heavy snow fall, so please dress accordingly.
            The <b>Puye Cliff Dwellings Adventure Tour</b> is more strenuous, and includes climbing wooden ladders to reach some dwellings.
            It is actually a combination of the other three tours.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There is a museum in the entrance building where the gift shop and ticket office are located.
            They are located inside a <b>Harvey House</b>, Harvey Houses are legendary lodges built by the Fred Harvey Company in the late 1800s.
            They were intended for tourists traveling to the Southwest by railroad tours.
            The Harvey House at Puye Cliffs is the only one which was built on an Indian reservation.
            It was made from volcanic rock and tufa block masonry.
            The museum contains an exhibition of items which were excavated by <b class="smallCaps">Edgar Hewett</b> in cooperation with the <b>Southwest Society of the Archaeological Institute of America</b> in 1907.
            It was the first systematic excavation of a prehistoric pueblo in the Rio Grande valley.
            However, the exhibition tells the story from the perspective of the Santa Clara Pueblo people.
