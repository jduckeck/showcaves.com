        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Ellinwood</b> was named for Capt. <b class="smallCaps">John Ellinwood</b>,
            chief civil engineer and surveyor for the AT &amp; SF.
            He camped near here in the fall of 1871, half a year before the town was founded
            by <b class="smallCaps">George M. Jackson</b>.
            He was the town's first merchant selling whiskey and tobacco.
            After the railroad reached Ellinwood in the summer of the same year, growth
            speeded up.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Most of the immigrants were from Germany, and they brought their own culture and
            architecture.
            The houses were heated with coal, which was delivered during summer by horse and
            wagon.
            They stored the coal in the cellar until it was used during winter.
            It is not clear who started this, local lure says they brought it from
            <i>Munich</i>, but someone built a ditch in front of his house and covered it by
            wooden planks.
            So it could be used as a sidewalk, and when the coal was delivered the planks
            were lifted and the the coal dumped in.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There are some rumours that the tunnels became a refuge during the anti-German
            hysteria at the time of World War I.
            This is possible, but not documented though.
            Shure is the fact, that the tunnels were used as a safe refuge when tornadoes
            were in the area.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The ditches became obsolete as coal storage, when in the 1930s the gas boom
            began.
            The buildings were now heated with the inexpensive natural gas, and at the same
            time continuing influx of population increased the need for shops and and
            services.
            The heavy limestone built basements provided space for the shops, the tunnels
            were used as underground sidewalks.
            The tunnels ran at both sides of Main Street for two blocks, connecting
            <b>Jung's Barber Shop</b> with public bath house, <b>Wolitz Shoe Shop</b>,
            <b>John Wever's Sample Room</b>, <b>Petz Meat Storage</b>, and <b>Drummer's
            Sample Room</b>, just to name a few.
            There is some evidence that at least one, probably even two tunnels crossed Main
            Street underground.
            This allowed the ladies to cross the street without wading through the mud, an
            early mall was born.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            When prohibition started in Kansas, the underground shops became ideal for less
            legal purposes.
            Although not really hidden, they were at least out of sight of state officials.
            Since World War II, separation walls were built to block access from one
            building to another.
            The use of the tunnels ended, but they stayed almost unchanged for decades.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In 1981 <b class="smallCaps">Adrianna Dierolf</b> began to show the tunnels to
            the public.
            In summer 1982 new sidewalks were built on Main Street and most of the remaining
            tunnels were filled with sand.
            They still exist, but are blocked now.
            Today three parts of the tunnels are still open, under the Dick Building, the
            Wolf Hotel, and the 1883.
            The part under the Dick Building is open to the public.
            It was sold to the Ellinwood Museum Association in 1992 who still offer guided
            tours.
