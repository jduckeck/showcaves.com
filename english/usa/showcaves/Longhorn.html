        <p>
            <b>Longhorn Caverns</b> was formed as a river cavern, which explains its typical character.
            The cave has very little formations but shows the impressive results of running water.
            Huge rounded forms like kolks and scours.
            The river was a result of the high humidity during the last cold age.
            When it ended 10,000 years ago the area became semi-arid and the river vanished.
            Still the cave was flooded now and then by flood events, which created thick layers of sediment.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave was used by man since prehistoric times, which was shown by archaeological excavations.
            While the indigenous natives knew about the cave, the white man discovered the cave in the 1840s when he arrived in this area.
            It was named <b>Sherrard's Cave</b>, but it is lost in time who this Sherrard was, most likely either the discoverer or the owner of the land.
            During Civil War the cave was used to manufacture and store gunpowder.
            Later it was a hideout for outlaws.
            Among the legends is one, that the outlaw <b class="smallCaps">Sam Bass</b> hid a $2 million cache of stolen money inside.
            Legend also says, Texas Rangers rescued a kidnapped girl from Indians in the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            During the prohibition years in the 1920s the cavern was used as a speakeasy.
            It became quite popular and had life musicians and dance events.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The transformation into a State Park started in 1931 when the State of Texas purchased the ranch with the cavern.
            It was necessary to buy all the surrounding land for the park which took five years.
            At the same time Company 854 of the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed Texas Park Road 4 which made the cave accessible by car.
            Also residences, pavilions and an observation tower in the National Park Service Rustic architectural style were erected.
            The cave was developed, tons of of cave sediments removed, walkways and staircases built.
            The cave was opened to the public in 1937.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            It was operated as a State owned show cave for decades, but it seems sometime in the 1990s the situation became lackadaisical.
            The tours by rangers were outsourced to a company.
            Unfortunately they were not interested to invest any money into the infrastructure and the situation still left a lot of room for improvement.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            It seems the situation changed around 2006 with <b class="smallCaps">Steven Kurtz</b>, curator of Longhorn Cavern State Park.
            He introduced the <b>Simple Sounds</b> concert series and offered chamber music in the cave.
            It was quite popular and featured in an episode of <b>Texas Country Reporter</b> with <b class="smallCaps">Kaye Barlow</b> as the travel guide.
            In 2008 country music and dance came back to the cave with the local Burnet County band <b>Redneck Jedi</b>.
            Fantastic Fest hosted an after party for the premiere of the movie <b>City of Ember</b>.
            The State Park was dedicated a U.S. Historic district, got a new light system, and finally became a filming location for a YouTube interactive series.
