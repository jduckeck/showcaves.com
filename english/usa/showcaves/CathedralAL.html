        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Cathedral Caverns</b> was developed by a single man, <b class="smallCaps">Jay
            Gurley</b>, who after he had first seen the cave, sold all his posessions to buy
            it and worked ten years to make it a show cave.
            He used 65km of cable to install an electric lighting with 80,000 Watt.
            When he showed this cave to his wife the first time, she was impressed by the
            huge <b>Big Room</b>.
            She said it resembled her a <b>cathedral</b>.
            At this time the cave was called Bat Cave, but Gurley changed the name into
            Cathedral Caverns.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The area is called Kennamer Cove after the Kennamer family, who settled here in
            1803.
            Their house stood 275m north of the cave.
            Like the native Indians before, they must have known the cave, at least the
            entrance.
            It was noted for its cave creek, and the fact that it stayed warm in the coldest
            winter and cool enough during summer to store meat.
            We guess they never entered the cave very far, and so we guess it was really <b
                class="smallCaps">Jay Gurley</b> who first explored and discovered the beautiful
            cave behind.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This cave has the world's largest cave entrance, 7.6 meters high by 38.4 meters
            wide.
            And, of course it has <b>world's largest stalagmite</b>, called <b>Goliath</b>.
            Kindof.
            Probably this cave has Alabamas largest cave entrance, we do not know this.
            But there are at least dozens of other caves with taller entrances all over the
            world.
            Have a look at our list of
            <a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../explain/Statistics/Portal.html"><img class="ui-li-icon ui-corner-none symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Explain.png" alt="Explain">Caves With The Tallest Cave Entrance</a></li>
            to find many of them.
            Caves in the upper league have more than 120m high and 100m wide entrances, we
            think thats a little more than 38.4m.
            The same is with tallest stalagmites, see
        <li><a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../explain/Statistics/Stalagmites.html"><img class="ui-li-icon ui-corner-none symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Explain.png" alt="Explain">Caves With The Tallest Stalagmite</a></li>
        .
        Goliath is 13.7m high and 74m in circumference.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            It is always funny to us, to discover such <b>absurd</b> world records.
            But the problem is: thousands of cave visitors will believe this nonsense.
            So why do the cave guides tell this sort of lies?
            We guess that in most cases they just do not know better.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In the case of Cathedral Caverns it is much worse: it seems they lately searched
            the internet or speleologic literature, to find new statistical highlights.
            So they now offer six different world records, which are either a bit
            complicated, like the <b>widest entrance of any commercial cave in the
            world</b> (which is not true either).
            Or they are simply fantastic, like the <b>largest frozen waterfall</b>.
            By inventing a new type of speleothem which does not exist anywhere else, their
            own one is definitely the biggest one.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            We think that this cave even holds two more world records: cave with worlds most
            faked world records and cave with the coolest and most educated cave guides in
            the world.
            So if you visit Cathedral Caverns, enjoy the natural beauty of the place, the
            impressive entrance, the huge chamber and the speleothems and <b>do not believe
            anything your guide tells you</b>!
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            And a last word.
            I enjoyed reading about the superlatives of this cave.
            I also enjoyed writing this article.
            About once a year I receive an infuriated email from someone who is angry that
            I insulted "his" cave.
            Two arguments are in each of those emails.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            First, this cave was really beautiful and why could I say a bad word about such
            a beautiful cave, if I never visited it.
            The fact that I never visited this cave is true, although the writers just
            assumed this.
            I guess I would be killed by infuriated cave guides if I did.
            However, by carfully reading the text above you will see, that I never disputed
            the beauty of the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The second argument is the fact that I insulted the guides, which, obviously, do
            not work any more at the cave and actually the tours are now as accurate and
            informative as possible.
            I can't insult someone by telling he was a liar, if he really is a liar.
            And obviously they have some energy in inventing creative superlatives.
            However, the official State Park(!) website still tells the <i>Goliath is
            tallest</i> stuff until today [JUL-2007]!
            How should I believe they do not tell this at the tour?
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At last I really enjoy the emails I recieve.
            They are almost as funny as the faked world records.
            Keep sending them.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            <b>Update 27-SEP-2008:</b>
            We recieved an email from Bill who went to the cave this morning.
            He has seen signs telling about the <b>4 world records</b>.
            And he guesses that they were kept from the early days of the cave before it was
            a State Park.
            He says this was the way roadside attractions marketed themselves.
            We have heard similar things, and actually this is the same all over the world.
            The owners of commercial caves are normally not very good in geology, so they
            tell some stories or probably some "facts" they heard 20 years ago.
            And so it might be extremely outdated and actually wrong.
            On the other hand, it is now a State Park, and they should start telling more
            accurate facts and probably explain how those legends started.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Three more comments by Bill, we are happy to publish here:
            (1) Disney filmed their film <b>Tom and Huck</b> here, (2) if you get the chance
            to visit, it's worth it, and (3) the guides are quite nice.
            No objections from our side.
        </p>
