        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Woodward Cave</b> was named after the nearby village Woodward.
            The large entrance of the cave was known to the local <b>Seneca Indians</b> for a very long time.
            A legend tells, the Indians buried their dead in the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is the ponor (swallow hole) for <b>Pine Creek</b>, at least during flood times.
            In dry times the river disappears before reaching the cave's entrance.
            The floods brought huge amounts of debris, clay and other sediments, and some cave passages were choked completely until the cave was developed in 1925 by local businesmen.
            They first built a diversion channel to carry the water down the valley.
            Since then no flooding has occured in the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A nice idea are colourful <b>Indian blankets</b>, which are provided for visitor without warm clothes.
            Visitor groups with those blanket make a nice motive for photographs.
            But the blankets are really necessary, as the cave has only 4 °C.
        </p>


        <div class="foreign">

            <p>
                A 30 m long entrance passage leads to the first chamber with a large speleothem
                called the <b>Liberty Bell</b>.
                A left hand turn leads to two fallen limestone blocks which rest on the floor.
                Passing through a narrower passage one comes to a room containing the <b>Hanging
                Forest</b>, one of the largest groups of stalactites in the cave.
                This group exhibits a considerable variety of shapes and sizes of pendant forms.
                Another passage brings one back to <b>The Great Room</b>, measuring 50 m by 70 m.
                At the foot of the steps leading to this room there is a hole in the floor where
                water can be seen.
                In a dry season the water can fall 20 m.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                In <b>The Great Room</b> speleothems abound, including small stalactites and
                pendant films, a few stalagmites, much flowstone, a large fallen block built up
                with dripstone called the <b>Red Panther's funeral pyre</b>, the large
                stalagmite <b>Tower of Babel</b>, and a dainty natural setting around a little
                pool called <b>The Crystal Lake</b>.
                The main passages are fairly level and only the first 30 m are retraced.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The cave was known to the Native Americans as <b>Red Panther Cave</b> because of
                the following legend, which has been discovered and handed down on to us by the
                historical research of Colonel <b class="smallCaps">Henry W Shoemaker</b>, of
                Me-Elhattan.

        <div class="foreign">

            <p>
                Red Panther was the son of an aged Seneca Chief, whose tribe lived in the Valley
                of the Beech Tree.
                The beech tree from which the valley took its name was beloved by the Storm God,
                and was reverenced by the Indians throughout the entire section.
                The beech was immune from the lightning of the Storm God, and under it the tribe
                would gather during fierce electrical storms, knowing that beneath its
                protecting branches they would find shelter and safety.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Personal triumphs, however, turned the head of the Red Panther, and he became
                cruel and warlike.
                He respected neither the beech nor the Storm God, and often threatened to
                destroy the tree to show that he considered himself mightier than the Great
                Spirit.
                Finally, upon his return from an unusually successful hunting expedition, the
                young brave cut down the tree in spite of the pleadings of his aged father.
                Red Panther then ordered his favourites to cut it into proper lengths, and when
                this was done, the sticks were carefully laid in a heap and the proud warrior
                leaned forward to light the blaze himself.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                As he did so, a sudden and terrific peal of thunder echoed from the clear sky,
                followed by a stroke of crimson lightning.
                The entire tribe was stunned by the shock for an instant, and upon their
                recovery, the lifeless body of Red Panther was discovered lying across the newly
                kindled fire.
                The Storm God had taken his revenge.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Mountain River, the young brave's father, was the first to reach his side, and
                lifted up his son's body tenderly.
                Not a mark of any kind was found on the corpse, but life itself had departed.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Hoping to appease the wrath of the Storm God, the chiefs of the tribe decided to
                place the body in the cavern in a near-by hillside, which had long been
                reverenced in religious ceremonials.
                After prolonged prayer, the mortal remains of Red Panther were taken to one of
                the largest of the chambers in the cave and placed in state.
                Chanting the tribal dirges, the guard of honour withdrew, leaving the corpse
                alone in its natural sepulchre.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                After due time, in which all manner of supplication was offered, Mountain River
                and his chiefs returned to the cave, expecting that the Storm God would relent
                and restore the young man to life.
                Instead, they found that water from the roof of the cavern had fallen onto the
                body and the luxurious bier on which it rested, turning the whole into stone.
                The outline of the body were preserved in the rock formation, and fearing
                another sacrilege, Mountain River and his followers withdrew, leaving Red
                Panther to sleep his last sleep undisturbed.
            </p>
