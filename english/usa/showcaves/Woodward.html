        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Woodward Cave</b> was named after the nearby village Woodward.
            The large entrance of the cave was known to the local <b>Seneca Indians</b> for a very long time.
            A legend tells, the Indians buried their dead in the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is the ponor (swallow hole) for <b>Pine Creek</b>, at least during flood times.
            In dry times the river disappears before reaching the cave’s entrance.
            The floods brought huge amounts of debris, clay and other sediments, and some cave passages were choked completely until the cave was developed in 1925 by local businessmen.
            They first built a diversion channel to carry the water down the valley.
            Since then no flooding has occurred in the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is famous for huge passages which are completely filled with clay, and actually offer a great potential for future explorations.
            However, any such exploration requires digging.
            The mud and clay were deposited in the cave in cycles, depending on the amount of water the clay was either deposited or removed.
            In between the mud was covered by a layer of calcite, the beginning of a stalagmite, then the clay was removed again, but the calcite ledge remained.
            Numerous such ledges make clear that there were numerous such cycles.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is often said to be one of the "largest" caverns in Pennsylvania, whatever that means.
            We checked the official long caves list, but it’s not even listed, and they have listed 14 caves longer than 2 km in PA.
            We could not find out how long this cave is, because they do not publish this number, but <b class="smallCaps">Ralph W Stone</b> published a length of 400 ft in 1930.
            That’s quite sobering.
            There is actually a quite large stalagmite formation, which is again dubbed the largest in the state.
            There are no official lists of speleothems, and they do not actually give the size, so again that’s just unproven marketing babble.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave has a huge bat population, which is the reason why it is closed during winter, that’s for bat protection.
            The endangered Indiana Bat was first recognized in Pennsylvania in the 1920s in this cave.
            Long time people were indifferent, but after worldwide massive endangerment of bats in the 1970s, there was finally some effort started in the 1980s.
            Here in the cave the solid steel doors were replaced by bat-friendly gates that allow them to enter and leave the cave.
            As a result the bat population grew to over 4000 individuals from 1988 to 2009.
            But in winter 2010 White Nose Syndrome reached Woodward Cave.
            This is such a massive threat that the population was reduced to little over 1000.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A nice idea were colourful <b>Indian blankets</b>, which were provided for visitor without warm clothes.
            Visitor groups with those blanket made a nice motive for photographs.
            But the blankets are now replaced sweat shirts which are available for purchase at the souvenir shop.
            Also, there is a rather strange statement which says that the cave is open all years but guided tours are available only from MAY to SEP.
            We guess that’s nonsense, because the cave is gated and is closed by law for bat protection at least NOV to APR.
            Also, quite weird are the tours for groups, they offer three types of tours depending on the number of participants.
            If you go there and purchase a ticket or book online you will attend the normal tour.
            Small group of up to 12 people my book a private tour which costs a fixed amount, independent of the number of participants.
            Bigger groups can book tours for reduced fees.

                A 30 m long entrance passage leads to the first chamber with a large speleothem called the <b>Liberty Bell</b>.
                A left hand turn leads to two fallen limestone blocks which rest on the floor.
                Passing through a narrower passage one comes to a room containing the <b>Hanging Forest</b>, one of the largest groups of stalactites in the cave.
                This group exhibits a considerable variety of shapes and sizes of pendant forms.
                Another passage brings one back to <b>The Great Room</b>, measuring 50 m by 70 m.
                At the foot of the steps leading to this room there is a hole in the floor where water can be seen.
                In a dry season the water can fall 20 m.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                In <b>The Great Room</b> speleothems abound, including small stalactites and pendant films, a few stalagmites, much flowstone, a large fallen block built up with dripstone called the <b>Red Panther’s funeral pyre</b>, the large stalagmite <b>Tower of Babel</b>, and a dainty natural setting around a little pool called <b>The Crystal Lake</b>.
                The main passages are fairly level and only the first 30 m are retraced.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The cave was known to the Native Americans as <b>Red Panther Cave</b> because of the following legend, which has been discovered and handed down on to us by the historical research of Colonel <b class="smallCaps">Henry W Shoemaker</b>, of Me-Elhattan.
            </p>

            <br>

        <div class="foreign">

            <p>
                <b class="smallCaps">Red Panther</b> was the son of an aged Seneca Chief, whose tribe lived in the Valley of the Beech Tree.
                The beech tree from which the valley took its name was beloved by the Storm God, and was reverenced by the Indians throughout the entire section.
                The beech was immune from the lightning of the Storm God, and under it the tribe would gather during fierce electrical storms, knowing that beneath its protecting branches they would find shelter and safety.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Personal triumphs, however, turned the head of the <b class="smallCaps">Red Panther</b>, and he became cruel and warlike.
                He respected neither the beech nor the Storm God, and often threatened to destroy the tree to show that he considered himself mightier than the Great Spirit.
                Finally, upon his return from an unusually successful hunting expedition, the young brave cut down the tree in spite of the pleadings of his aged father.
                <b class="smallCaps">Red Panther</b> then ordered his favourites to cut it into proper lengths, and when this was done, the sticks were carefully laid in a heap and the proud warrior leaned forward to light the blaze himself.
                As he did so, a sudden and terrific peal of thunder echoed from the clear sky, followed by a stroke of crimson lightning.
                The entire tribe was stunned by the shock for an instant, and upon their recovery, the lifeless body of <b class="smallCaps">Red Panther</b> was discovered lying across the newly kindled fire.
                The Storm God had taken his revenge.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                <b class="smallCaps">Mountain River</b>, the young brave’s father, was the first to reach his side, and lifted his son’s body tenderly.
                Not a mark of any kind was found on the corpse, but life itself had departed.
                Hoping to appease the wrath of the Storm God, the chiefs of the tribe decided to place the body in the cavern in a near-by hillside, which had long been reverenced in religious ceremonials.
                After prolonged prayer, the mortal remains of <b class="smallCaps">Red Panther</b> were taken to one of the largest of the chambers in the cave and placed in state.
                Chanting the tribal dirges, the guard of honour withdrew, leaving the corpse alone in its natural sepulchre.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                After due time, in which all manner of supplication was offered, Mountain River and his chiefs returned to the cave, expecting that the Storm God would relent and restore the young man to life.
                Instead, they found that water from the roof of the cavern had fallen onto the body and the luxurious bier on which it rested, turning the whole into stone.
                The outline of the body were preserved in the rock formation, and fearing another sacrilege, Mountain River and his followers withdrew, leaving <b class="smallCaps">Red Panther</b> to sleep his last sleep undisturbed.

                <b class="smallCaps">David Lewis</b> was a notorious highwayman from Centre County who terrorised the border roads in the early 19th century.
                <b class="smallCaps">Lewis</b> was regarded by some as Pennsylvania’s authentic Robin Hood.
                The young bandit was welcomed and cared for in every mountain cabin under the motto "He took from the rich and gave to the poor".
                He is said to have used Woodward Cave to hide his ill-gotten gains and to hide from the authorities.
                Lewis was also a bit of a Don Juan, stealing the hearts of many young women.
                Scandalous rumours link him to the beautiful <b class="smallCaps">Daltera Sanry</b>, with whom he allegedly often met in the cave.

            <p class="indentedText">
                <b class="smallCaps">Daniel Lewis</b> met his untimely end in Bellefonte Jail.
                During an unsuccessful escape attempt he was shot and died soon after.
                He died on 20-JUL-1820, but not before writing a confession about his short life as a criminal on his deathbed.
