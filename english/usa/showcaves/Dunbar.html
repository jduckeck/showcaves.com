        <h2>Description</h2>

        <div class="foreign">

            <p>
                Dunbar Cave is located 60 minutes northwest of Nashville and about one and a half miles northeast of downtown Clarksville.
                Dunbar Cave is the most prominent of several caves located in this designated natural area.
                In front of the cave, square dances, radio shows, and big band era concerts were once held.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The entrance is 5 m wide and 2.4 m high and in the summer emits a strong and uniform breeze which has a temperature of 10-15 °C.
                A roomy entrance passage leads to Counterfeiter’s Room, so named after being used by counterfeiter’s in 1824.
                Among the places of note are the <b>Music Hall</b> which is 0.2 hectares in area, up to
                10 m high; the <b>Ball Room</b>, which is 15 m by 120 m in extent; Dunbar’s Coffin;
                Spray Hall; Rocky Mountain; The Cathedral, The Saltpeter Mine; Lover’s Leap;
                Peterson’s Leap; Relief Hall; Great Relief Hall and <b>Independence Hall</b>.
                The latter is about 0.8 hectares in extent and contains a wealth of speleothems of all shapes and sizes.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The present day "Cave Hike" follows the old cave tour, but the lack of concrete pathways etc make this trip more difficult than the average show cave.
            </p>

            <p>
                Text by <b class="smallCaps">Tony Oldham</b> (2005).

        <p>
            In 2005 more than 30 prehistoric cave drawings and etchings were discovered.
            They were dated to be of Mississippian Age, which means created between 700 and 1300 AD.
            The drawings show stars, circles, crosses, a swastika and a figure of a Mississippian supernatural warrior.
            The drawings are generally interpreted as religious symbols.
            After the installation of a more secure gate at the cave mouth, to protect the archaeological findings, the cave paintings are now open to the public.
            There are 53 caves with documented prehistoric finds, but most are on private property and this is the only one open for public viewing.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Once every year an event called <b>Cooling at the Cave</b> takes place at Dunbar Cave.
            It is an old tradition which started when air conditioning did not exist.
            The women with their children came to the cave and stayed at the cool entrance area, where the cold air from the cave provides a natural cooling effect.
            After work the husbands met their family here for a dinner picnic at the cave.
            During the day, tables were provided for playing card games or bingo, in the evening the tables were removed to make room for music and dancing.
            Once the cave was owned by country music star <b class="smallCaps">Roy Acuff</b>, who added an olympic sized swimming pool and many other amenities.
            During the Big Band era there were numerous concerts at the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave lost its appeal in the 1950s, and was sold to <b class="smallCaps">McKay King</b> in 1963, who closed the swimming pool.
            The golf course was sold, the swimming pool filled in, the bathhouse transformed into the Visitor center of the new State Park.
            And even the electric light was removed, today the cave is guided with handheld lamps.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Dunbar Cave is planning to revamp its museum.
            As far as we understand the realization of this project depends on public funding.
            A fund of $250,000 was promised in 2006 but later cut from the budget.
            Now again a fund, this time $400,000 is promised from the 2011 budget.
            It is dedicated for the research and design work for two new exhibitions, one about the geologic aspects and one about the human use of the cave in prehistoric and historic times.
