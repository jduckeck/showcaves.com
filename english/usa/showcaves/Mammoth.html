                    A Novel about Mammoth Cave and its people.
                    Pat lived at Mammoth Cave for seven years.
                    Her husband was the caves historian/researcher.
                    Using his archives she has written a historical novel which is very close to the truth.
                    She uses the names of real people to describe events that actually happened at Mammoth Cave 150 years ago.

        <p>
            <b>Mammoth Cave</b> is the longest cave of the world with more 570 kilometers of passages.
            This length is so extraordinary, the second largest cave of the world is the Jewel Cave, South Dakota, U.S.A., which is <i>"only"</i> 218km long.
            And although it is very unlikely the length of Mammoth Cave will be reached in the next future by any other cave, place two is still changing now and then because of new discoveries.
            And its length is not the only superlative, its light system was renovated in 2006 for USD 6 Million.
            The result was an electrical system with 1,200 light fixtures, 73km of wiring and 47 phones for 9.6km of cave trails.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Mammoth Cave system is so huge, it extends over two mountain ranges.
            Once the cave systems in both mountains were explored separately, until the connection between both was found in the 1960s.
            The second cave, <b>Flint Ridge</b> was nearly as big as Mammoth Cave.
            The formal name of the whole system is <b>Mammoth-Cave-Flint-Ridge-System</b>, but as this name is rather long it is simply called Mammoth Cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Several entrances of the cave system were separately developed for tourists.
            Some of them were not known to be the same cave, so they have their own names.
            They were named <b>Short Cave</b>, <b>Salts Cave</b>, <b>Long Cave</b>, <b>Colossal Cave</b>, <b>Bedquilt cave</b>, <b>Unknown Cave</b>, <b>Great Onyx Cave</b>, <b>Great Crystal Cave</b>, <b>Crystal Cave</b>, <b>Sand Cave</b>, or <b>Collins Crystal Cave</b>.
            Some show caves are closed now or only visited on so-called historic cave tours.
            Being the biggest, most important and best developed Cave Park in the World, there are numerous different tours of all lengths, durations, and physical conditions.
            Rather new is a photography tour, which is much appreciated by amateur cave photographers.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Mammoth Cave is one of the earliest tourist attraction in the United States.
            It was first promoted in 1816, second after Niagara Falls, New York.
            In other words, it is the first show cave in the U.S.A. open to the public.
            Many people owned the land and the caves since the early 19th century, most of them were farmers, which actually owned the land, which accidentally had caves.
            Some were mining saltpeter from the cave, especially for the War of 1812 and the Civil War.
            And notable is Dr <b class="smallCaps">John Croghan</b> who owned the cave from 1839 to his death in 1849.
            He tried to help tuberculosis patients and first built two huts in Audubon Avenue for them.
            A year later tuberculosis patient Dr. <b class="smallCaps">William J. Mitchell</b> and nine others move to Mammoth Cave.
            This is the only test of <b>speleotherapy</b> with tuberculosis patients.
            After a year some had died in the cave and not one has become better, the experiment shows that cave air does not cure tuberculosis.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Probably the most famous guide and cave explorer of Mammoth cave is <b class="smallCaps">Stephen Bishop</b> (-1857).
            He discovered miles of passages, underground rivers, and gypsum-decorated chambers.
            He became a cave guide in 1838 after <b class="smallCaps">Franklin Gorin</b> purchased the cave.
            But he was intelligent and he listened to the academic visitors when they explained something.
            He was described as
        </p>

        <p class="foreign">
            “a self-educated man...
            He had a fine genius, a great fund of wit and humor, some little knowledge of Latin and Greek, and much knowledge of geology, but his great talent was his knowledge of man…
            His talents were of the first order.
            He was trustworthy and reliable; he was companionable; he was a hero and he could be a clown.
            He knew a gentleman or a lady as if by instinct.
            He learned whatever he wished to learn without trouble or labor, and professors of geology spoke highly of his knowledge in that department of science.”
            <br>
            <b class="smallCaps">Franklin Gorin</b>
        </p>

        <p class="">
            Bishop discovered the <b>Mammoth Dome</b> and the <b>Ruins of Karnak</b>, he was the first who crossed the <b>Bottomless Pit</b> on a guided tour with a visitor and thus extended the cave by miles.
            In 1942 on a visit at Dr <b class="smallCaps">John Croghan</b>'s house he drew a map of the explored passageways of the cave from memory.
            This map was published in the book
            <a target="_top" href="../../explain/Literature/MammothRambles.html"><img alt="Book" class="ui-li-icon ui-corner-none symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Book.png">Rambles in the Mammoth Cave</a>.
            He was a popular guide and was often requested by tourists, he was "...almost as widely known as the Cave itself.”
            But like many guides at that time he was a slave.
            He gained his freedom in 1856 and continued working at Mammoth Cave as a guide, but now paid.
            He died in JUL-1857 and was buried in an unmarked grave in a small cemetery that Dr. <b class="smallCaps">Croghan</b> had established for some of his deceased patients.
            It was later named the <b>Old Guide’s Cemetery</b> in honor of many cave guides who were buried here.
