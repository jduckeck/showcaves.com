<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
<b>Secret Caverns</b>, like many New York state caves, has huge domes connected
by windings passages and a cave river.
And like most caves in the area, it was formed during the Ice Ages, the cave
stream contains gravel which shows evidence of glacial action.
During the cold periods the northern part of America was covered by enormous
glaciers.
The melting water of those huge masses of ice created many caves, by its
enormous erosional forces.
This cave was formed approximately during the last 300,000 years.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The cave was opened to the public in 1929 by <b class="smallCaps">Roger H.
Mallery</b>, who intented to keep the cave as natural as possible.
At first the visitors had to descend 25m on rope and then crawl through 60m of
narrow passage to reach the larger inner chambers.
Today we would call this selunking tours, and it would be a great success.
At this time it was too strenuous for most visitors, so soon he decided to do
further development.
He installed a wooden walkway, metal ladders, and electric light.
A few years later he replaced the wooden walkway by a concrete one and the
ladders by concrete steps.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The upper layers of <b>Coeymans Limestone</b>, where the cave is located in, are
very rich in fossils.
The crinoids, spiral coral, and brachiopods can be seen in the cave walls during
the first descent into the cave.
Other fossils like nautiloids, sea scorpions, and trilobites can be found in the
surrounding area or purchsed in the gift shop.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
But the main attraction of the cavern is a roaring subterranean waterfall of 33m
height.
There is a kind of urban legend, that the water is pumped from a pond on the
surface artificially.
The owners on the other hand assure that it is not pumped artificially in any
way.
A caver from the US told me the following story, which he purported happened in
the 1960s.
</p>

<br>

<p>
<EM>
Local caver lore says, some cavers put fluoresceine in a nearby pond, then
joined the next tour.
When the guide turned on the lights as the tour entered that section of cave,
the pump started up, and the water began falling (before the tour got there to
witness it, of course).
When they reached the waterfall, the guide was in the middle of his spell about
it being the tallest waterfall in the state when it suddenly turned bright
green.
The guide was dumbfounded, the cavers in stitches, and the rest of the tourists
just confused.
</EM>
</p>

<br>

<p>
However, the owners seem not to like those stories very much.
They guess they were spread by their competitors up the road, together with
other rumors, like the one the cave was blasted out artificially.
We can not tell if there is a sort of <i>cave war</i> going on, but we
guess such stories are a very good and cheap publicity.
