        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The cave was known to the local Native Americans and called <b>Otsgaragee</b>.
            This name is traditionally translated <b>Cave of the Great Galleries</b>, which would imply that they entered the cave and visited the galleries.
            There are others who think it means <b>Great Valley Cave</b> and they never entered the cave because of superstitions.
            The Iroquois Native Americans of the Schoharie Valley fled the area at the end of the American Revolution.
            There is no reliable knowledge if they entered the cave as no archaeological remains were found inside the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            During the 1770s the peddler <b class="smallCaps">Johnathan Schmul</b> took refuge from a Native American attack in the entrance of a cave.
            He told this Rev. <b class="smallCaps">John Peter Resig</b>, the local pastor, who wrote it down, but as location and description are missing, its only a guess that he discovered Howe Cavern.
            There are other caves in the area, for example Secret Cavers, and we have only little more than a legend with a funny name.
            We think the name Schmul was quite popular with Monty Python.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In the early 1800s the Howe family moved to the area, and they heard legends about cold air coming out of the ground.
            The official version of the story tells that <b class="smallCaps">Lester Howe</b> was looking for his cows on a hot day, 22-MAY-1842.
            He found them at a place where the air was actually colder, so he discovered the <i>Blowing Rock</i>.
            He credited  a cow named <b class="smallCaps">Millicent</b> for helping with the discovery.
            The place was on land owned by neighbor and friend, <b class="smallCaps">Henry Wetsel</b>, and he entered the cave together with his neighbor on the same day.
            They frequently went to the cave and explored it piece by piece, and finally they built a raft and crossed the <b>Lake of Venus</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In 1943 <b class="smallCaps">Howe</b> purchased the property from <b class="smallCaps">Henry Wetsel</b> for $100.
            He did a little development work, built a cave hotel at the entrance, and offered tours for 50 cent.
            The tours took eight to ten hours and were actually cave trekking tours.
            He also played violin in the <b>Bronze Room</b> and shot Roman candles into the <b>Great Rotunda</b>.
            It seems the tours with his personal touch were quite popular.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            With the opening of a railway station at nearby Howe Cave, the numer of visitors increased substantially.
            Howe’s Cave became a leading New York attraction.
            But in 1872 the second Cave Hotel burned and at the same time the public’s interest in caves waned.
            To finance a third construction of the hotel he entered into a joint stock agreement with railroad magnate <b class="smallCaps">Joseph H. Ramsey</b>.
            Ramsey was more interesting in mining limestone and producing cement and offered to by <b class="smallCaps">Howe</b>s interest.
            Finally in 1888 <b class="smallCaps">Howe</b> sold at the age of 59 and retired.
            The Howes Cave Association managed the cave but the number of visitors steadily decreased, and finally in 1898 the cave was closed to the public.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cement manufacturing required large amounts of high quality limestone.
            The cave was actually not of interest, because it is a hole filled with clay and other sediments.
            So the quarrying happened nearby.
            Nevertheless between 1910 and 1925 the quarry face reached Howe’s Cave and about 266m of cave passage were destroyed over time.
            This is about half of the original cave tour.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In 1927 <b class="smallCaps">John Mosner</b> of Syracuse and <b class="smallCaps">Walter H. Sagendorf</b> of Saranac Lake started the development of the cave as a show cave.
            <b class="smallCaps">Sagendorf</b>'s brother <b class="smallCaps">John Sagendorf</b> owned the land where the cave entrance is today.
            And <b class="smallCaps">Sagendorf</b> organized the plan of the engineer <b class="smallCaps">Mosner</b> to build an elevator, trails and electric light.
            On 11-OCT-1927 <b>Howe Caverns, Inc.</b> was organized as a closed stock corporation.
            The following year the development work started.
            A work force of well over 50 men constructed the elevator shaft, the trails in the cave and the new entrance buildings.
            The 47.5m deep elevator shaft with two elevators cost about USD 175,000.
            On 27-MAY-1929 the show cave was opened to the public.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Howe Caverns</b> lies in <b>Coeymans limestone</b> and <b>Manlius limestone</b>.
            Coeymans limestone can be seen in the upper portion of the cave near the entrance.
            Coeymans limestone is more difficult to dissolve than the Manlius variety, so the water naturally chooses a lower path through the Manlius layer.
            As a result, almost perfectly flat ceilings can be seen in parts of the cavern, which are actually the underside of the Coeymans limestone layer.
            Rondout waterlime is the cream-colored rock that runs along the underground stream.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In 2019 a new museum, which is closely related to the cave, was opened.
            The <b>Cave House Museum of Mining and Geology</b> is located on the opposite side of the limestone quarry.
            It is located in the hotel built by <b class="smallCaps">Lester Howe</b> for guests coming to visit the cave.
            The building survived as the office and chemistry lab for the cement plant.
            The museum was started in 2005 with the repair and restore of the Cave House.
            It shows the history of Howes Cave, the underground mine, the quarry and Portland cement plant, the current aggregate mining operation.
            It also has an exhibition on the geology of the area and New York State.
            The museum is owned and operated by a non-profit educational institution.
