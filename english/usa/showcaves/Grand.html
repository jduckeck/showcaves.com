        <p>
            <b>Grand Caverns</b> is the oldest show cave in the USA, it is open for the public continually for more than 200 years.
            The cave was discovered in 1804 by 18-year-old <b class="smallCaps">Bernard Weyer</b>, a young trapper and the manager of the local distillery.
            According to local lore, he was looking for a missing raccoon trap.
            Another version of the story says that he stumbled upon the entrance while chasing an errant groundhog.
            When he reported the discovery, the locals started to call the cave <b>Weyer's Cave</b>, which was just descriptive in the sense <i>the cave which Weyer discovered</i>.
            But the name stuck.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The owner of the land was <b class="smallCaps">Matthias Amend</b>, so he was also the owner of the cave.
            He actually had the idea to open it for public visits, and he developed the cave with trails.
            Opened to the public only two years after its discovery, it was the first show cave in the U.S.A.
            He tried to name the show cave <b>Amend's Cave</b>, after himself, but he failed.
            The locals generally called it <b>Weyer's Cave</b>, and when potential visitors asked for the way to <b>Amend’s Cave</b>, this became a problem.
            It seems he realized this quite quickly and called it officially <b>Weyer's Cave</b>.
            Early publications and postcards used this name, but it was also called <b>Grottoes of the Shenandoah</b>.
            This is the reason why the nearby village was named <b>Grottoes</b>.
            However, there is also a show cave named
            <a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../usa/showcaves/Shenandoah.html"><img alt="Showcave" class="ui-li-icon ui-corner-none symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Showcave.png">Shenandoah Caverns</a>,
            which was opened to the public in 1922.
            About that time the name <b>Grottoes of the Shenandoah</b> got into disuse.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Many things from the early days are vague, it seems there are inaccurate descriptions and several misunderstandings, and it's quite hard to separate fact from fiction.
            For example, according to some sources, an unknown person first stumbled upon one of the entrances in the 1780s.
            Its unknown who this was and which entrance he actually discovered, only rumors remain.
            Also, some tell the cave was once named <b>Amon’s Cave</b> or <b>Amen’s Cave</b>, after the owner of the cave.
            This makes no sense, as the name of the first owner was <b class="smallCaps">Matthias Amend</b>.
            And the statement that the <b class="smallCaps">Mohler</b> family was the <b>first</b> owner is also wrong.
            The cave has gone through several owners in 200 years.
            In 1810, <b class="smallCaps">Matthias Amend</b> deeded the property to his daughter <b class="smallCaps">Mary</b> and her husband, <b class="smallCaps">Henry V. Bingham</b>.
            <b class="smallCaps">Bingham</b> sold the land to <b class="smallCaps">John Mohler</b> in 1819, and <b class="smallCaps">Jacob Mohler</b> became caretaker, followed by his nephew <b class="smallCaps">John Leonard Mohler</b> in 1840.
            There is even a picture of him in the following book.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            An early description of the cave written by <b class="smallCaps">David Hunter Strother</b> in his story <b>The Adventures of Porte Crayon and his Cousins</b>.
            <b class="smallCaps">Porte Crayon</b> is actually his pen name, derived from the French <i>porte-crayon</i> or pencil.
            This story is a sort of autobiographic travel diary from the pre-war Virginia.
            It is also full of nice drawings (hence his pen name).
            This story was published in 1857 in <b>Virginia illustrated</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In this time before the war, romanticism created numerous quite bombastic descriptions of the natural beauty of the cave.
            They were published in books, newspapers and gazettes.
            This was a continuous free advertisement for the show cave, which was thus quite popular.
            The number of visitors was restricted by the small number of people who were able to travel at all.
            At that time, farmers and workers had no chance to travel, there was no domestic mass tourism, only the rich and educated were potential visitors.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            During the <b>Civil War</b> (1861–1865), the cave was visited by both Confederate and Union soldiers.
            As common in these times, the visitors left their names on the walls of the cave.
            More than 230 signatures on the walls could be identified being from civil war soldiers.
            A funny story is told about the famous Confederate General, <b class="smallCaps">Stonewall Jackson</b>.
            He once camped nearby and allowed his men to visit the cave.
            But when asked if he was going to enter the cave, he answered <i>"No, I think not. I fear I shall be underground soon enough, and I have no desire to speed the process!"</i>
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            From 1889 to 1893, the <b>Grottoes Land Company</b> owned Weyers Cave.
            When they took over, they obviously renovated and modernized the show cave.
            As a result, the cave got electric light in 1889, and while this is quite early, numerous caves were electrified five years earlier.
            It was the fourth cave in the U.S.A. with electric light.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            It's a common pattern, a new owner makes some changes after the purchase, typically modernizations and renovations.
            The <b class="smallCaps">Pirkey</b> Brothers bought the property in 1910 and built a lime kiln on the property.
            Fortunately, the limestone quarrying caused no destruction to the cave.
            When <b class="smallCaps">Holly Stover</b> bought the cave in 1926 she renamed it <b>Grand Caverns</b>.
            The reasons for this rather drastic step are not given, most likely it was the idea to make it more popular by giving it a bombastic name.
            Actually, that's a poor idea, as people who know the old name get disoriented.
            Nevertheless, this time the name change stuck.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The early 1970s were a time with numerous changes for the cave.
            In 1973, the National Park Service designated the cave a <b>National Natural Landmark</b> in recognition of its shield formations and other features.
            In 1974, the owner <b class="smallCaps">Gladys Kellow</b> gifted the caverns and surrounding acreage to the Upper Valley Regional Park Authority (UVRPA).
            As a result, it was named <b>Grand Caverns Regional Park</b>.
            They operated the cave 35 years, until 2009 when the UVRPA dissolved and the Town of Grottoes took possession of the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave was surveyed in the 1930s and the length was about 2.6 km.
            In 2004, the management of Grand Caverns asked the Virginia Region chapter of the National Speleological Society to conduct a re-survey of the cave system.
            They did so and discovered a 20 cm high passage and more than 3.4 km of unexplored passages.
            Since then, the official length of the cave is more than 6 kilometers.

            The caves of the Shenandoah Valley were formed in mostly horizontal Cambrian limestone layers.
            This cave is extraordinary, as the limestone is folded at this place.
            At the place of the cave, the layers are vertical not horizontal, turned on-end by tectonic forces.
            The results are rather uncommon profiles of the passages.

            The cave entrance is located on a hillside in the Shenandoah Valley, surrounded by a small park and a popular picnic area.
            The cave is known for several huge chambers.
            <b>Cathedral Hall</b> is 85 m long and 21 m high, the biggest chamber in this cave and one of the largest rooms of any cavern in the East.
            The <b>Grand Ballroom</b> has a flat floor with a size of 460 m², which is why it was used for various events.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is famous for its numerous formations, most unusual are the rare

            which are shaped like disks.
            Grand has an abundance of 250 shields.

            The cave has coloured light, but fortunately only at a few spots.
            The signatures from the Civil War are also shown on the tour, and one of them is pointed out to the visitors, the signature of <b class="smallCaps">W. W. Miles</b>.
            Captain <b class="smallCaps">W. W. Miles</b>, of the 14th Pennsylvania Calvary, visited and the cave on 26-SEP-1864.
            This is another one of the mysteries mentioned above.
            Actually, the 14th Pennsylvania Calvary had a fight on the 26th and 27th.
            We have no idea how <b class="smallCaps">Miles</b> would have had the time to make a cave tour.
            Also, according to Wikipedia his name was actually <b class="smallCaps">William <b>F.</b> Miles</b>, and as we assume that he should know his second name, we can only guess that the signature is either fake or someone else.
