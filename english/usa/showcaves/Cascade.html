<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The special feature, which gave <b>Cascade Caverns</b> its name, is a 30m high
waterfall.
It is viewed as the finale of every tour.
Other highlights are several crystal clear pools.
But pools and waterfall may be dry during longer dry weather conditions.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Short after the Declaration of Independence of Texas in 1837, every houshold
received a piece of land.
Patent #64 with Cascade Caverns on it belonged to <b class="smallCaps">Jose
Ramon Arocha</b>.
It was unallocated and so <b class="smallCaps">William H. Steele</b> and <b
class="smallCaps">Ludovic Colquhoun</b>, two land speculators bought it.
During the following years the land was sold several times, but most likely none
of the owners ever saw it.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The first owners who really lived on the land were Dr. <b
class="smallCaps">Benjamin Hester</b> and his wife <b class="smallCaps">Jennie
Knox</b>.
He died a few years later and his widow sold the ground, but as he was the first
owner the cave was renamed <b>Hester's Cave</b> after him.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
At the same time the German author <b class="smallCaps">August Siemering</b>
(1830-1883) published a story called <b>Ein verfehltes Leben</b> (<i>An
Unsuccessful Life</i>) in the <i>Volksblatt</i>, a German newspaper published in
Cincinnati, Ohio.
The author lived in this area between 1847 and 1853, so he knew the cave.
The story tells about a hermit, who lived in a cave during the American Civil
War (1861-1865).
In the foreword he tells, that the story is based on events which happened in
the early German settlements of the Hill Country.
He does not tell the name of the cave, but many readers considered it was
Hester's Cave.
We also read about a German immigrant, who used the cave as a hideout during the
1840s, after he had tried to kill his wife's lover.
We guess that is just a twisted version of Siemering's story, or his story is
based on the legend.
The official website of Cascade Caverns and even libraries mixed up the title of
the story, and wrote <b>Ein verstehltes Leben</b>.
The word <i>verstehlt</i> does not exist in German, and is most likely a
misspelling based on the gothic font in which the German newspaper was printed.
In gothic letters the <b>s</b> and the <b>f</b> look very similar.
However, the story became widespread in 1932, when the English translation by <b
class="smallCaps">May E. Francis</b> was published under the title <b>The Hermit
of the Cavern</b>.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
In 1929 the ground was purchased by the family who still own the cave.
<b class="smallCaps">Alfred Gray</b> purchased the land and established
<b>Graymead Dairy</b> which he operated until it was shut down by the Great
Depression.
At this time he remembered the cave at the far end of his ground, and wondered
if this could become a source of income.
He contacted <b class="smallCaps">Dan</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Bernard
Cartwright</b> who explored caves in the area and had become quite knowledgable.
The cave was originally a round hole on the pasture, explorers descended into
the cave by rope.
Later the side of the cliff collapsed and it was possible to climb down the ramp
of debris.
Right behind the entrance there was a huge stalagmite blocking the main passage.
Visitors covered this part of the cave with graffitti and names, but before
anyone had returned at this point.
<b class="smallCaps">Alfred Gray</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Bernard
Cartwright</b> explroed the cave with the goal to find more.
They prepared well, with ropes, waders, flashlights, and a camera.
Candles and matches were used to test the quality of the air.
And they discovered passages, huge chambers, speleothems and the cascade.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Bernard Cartwright published a detailed article about the discovery with
pictures in November 1931 in a San Antonio newspaper.
Alfred Gray was poor, his dairy bankrupt, but <b class="smallCaps">Frank
Nicholson</b> read the article.
He had worked at Carlsbad Cavern before, so he knew how to develop a cave and he
found an investor, <b class="smallCaps">E. A. Drake</b> from Canada who financed
the development of the cave.
It was developed in a few months, opened to the public in April 1932.
The last chamber contained a silent lake and seven little waterfalls forming a
gentle cascade.
The huge chamber looked even bigger as it was reflected by the surface of the
dark lake.
The wife of the owner, <b class="smallCaps">Edith Gray</b>, named the chamber
<b>Cathedral Room</b> and renamed the cave <b>Cascade Cavern</b> because of this
cascade.
However, regular floodwaters have changed the room completely since then.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Since 2009 the cave has a new owner, the Richmond architect <b
class="smallCaps">Scott Kyle</b>.
He started to renovate the site, which is now lighted by a modern light system
with LED lamps.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
There are legends that the cave was known to native Indians who regularly took
refuge here.
A chimney in the cave ceiling works like a natural chimney, so this was a
comfortable shelter.
This is probably based on the many findings in the cave, but actually the
natural entrance was not very comfortable, as it was simply a vertical collapse
doline in the middle of the field.
Probaly the Indian remains were washed into the cave or thrown into it.
Another legend may be true: the owner before the Grays, <b class="smallCaps">L.
W. Menn</b> is said to have lowered visitors in a bucket on a rope, which was
lowered and lifted by a winch on his truck.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The cave is a rich source of Pleistocene fauna remains.
The tusk of a mastodon, a mastodon shinbone, bones of saber-tooth tigers, and
bisons were discovered.
The story of the tusk is again a little fantastic.
Legend tells, that several years after the original development the original
passage was widened.
The workmen discovered a 1.80m long tusk, which circled around a rock.
It was covered by flesh and hair, but as it was contacted by air it
disintegrated very fast.
The tusk was broken and fragile, so it was decided not to move it.
Today there are only a few fragments of it left, due to early souvenir hunters
and flooding.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
There are numerous endemic animals living in the cave.
A salamander found in the lake room was named <b>Cascade Caverns Salamander</b>
after the cave.
Also two kinds of frog have been discovered, Cliff Frogs and Leopard Frogs.
Cave Ground Beetles, Cave Harvestmen, and Cave Crickets also live in the cave.
Prominent cave visitors are Eastern Pipistrelle Bats.
