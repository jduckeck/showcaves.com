        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Kartchner Caverns</b> is one of the very few show caves which was recently opened to the public.
            This is the chance to see a cave in an extremely well preserved state, since most of the older show caves have a long history of fires, torches, candles, vandalism, lamp flora, and other damages.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Kartchner Caverns was discovered by two speleologists,<b class="smallCaps">Randy Tufts</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Gary Tenen</b> in 1974.
            In order to prevent the cave from being destroyed, they kept their secret for many years.
            After four years they told the property owners, <b class="smallCaps">James</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Lois Kartchner</b>, for the first time about the cave.
            The cave was named after the Kartchners, because of their devotion to the protection of the cave.
            After years of secret talks between cavers, owners and the Arizona State, the cave was finally purchased as an Arizona State Park in 1988.
            This was the first time the existence of the cave became known to the public.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            To preserve the formations, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the natural conditions of the cave.
            In the undeveloped cave the temperature would always stay at 21 °C and the humidity at 99%.
            To keep this conditions unchanged, even with 200,000 visitors a year and a dry desert climate outside, the cave was closed with airlocks and a special air conditioning system.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The opening of this cave was awaited for several years, first it was planned to open in 1997.
            But the difficult working conditions, building the trails by hand with no heavy equipment, caused a two years delay.
            The developing costs were $28 million.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Many people had heard about the cave and the run to booking tours resembled the sale of tickets to popular rock star concerts or football games.
            In only a few days after reservation was possible, all tours of 1999 and many of 2000 were sold out.
            Because of its extraordinary beauty, the cave is still very popular and pre-booking is still required.
            However, after 20 years you may have a good chance to get a ticket during off-season the day before.
            Nevertheless, prebooking by phone or internet is mandatory.
        </p>

        <br>

        <div class="foreign">

            <p>
                Preservation of the cave environment is the highest priority in the
                Cavern's management. At the end of each working day, the pathways are
                hosed down to remove hair, lint, skin cells and other debris. Pumps then
                drain off the water. After filtration is it reintroduced as a mist to
                maintain a high humidity to prevent the atmosphere drying as a result of
                visitors collecting moisture on their clothing and bodies and carrying it
                out of the cave.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The tour begins in the Rotunda Room, featuring many beautiful spelothems
                such as delicate straws, frozen waterfalls and numerous helictites.
                Lighting is both indirect and frontal, without any coloured lights. The
                visitor experiences semi-darkness, similar to the effect of the headlamps
                of a group of cavers. Some of the speleothems are back or side lit and
                are best viewed close up. The displays are so complex that it is
                impossible to see everything in one visit.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The other major feature of the Rotunda Room is the mud floor, which has
                cracked into large polygonal figures. A single-file path, made by the
                cave's original explorers, and by construction workers, crosses the mud
                floor near one wall. Fallen soda straws can be seen sticking out of the
                mud. Throughout the tour, it is almost impossible to realise that other
                groups are also in the cave, as the lights are skilfully turned on and
                off behind each group. Tours, with a limited number on each, leave every
                20 minutes.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Passing many delicate speleothems, the next major chamber is called the
                Throne Room. The main feature is a 18 m high column call Kubla Khan.
                This is the tallest column in Arizona. The path ascends to a platform,
                overlooking the room. Here the visitor takes a seat for a Son et
                Luminere show. A spot light illuminates the column, going up and down in
                time with the music, showing the great flutings and alternate white and
                brown bands on the column.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Like all good things the visit soon comes to an end and it is time to
                leave the cave, through the air tight door, off of the Throne Room.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                A second longer tour is planned which will include The Big Room.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Current waiting period for a booking is 2 weeks, so book well in advance.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Update 2004:
                The Big Room was opened to the public in November 2003.
                The tour is half a mile in length and makes a loop around the perimeter of the
                room and through the adjacent <b>Strawberry Room</b>.
                Only open October 15 to April 15 because The Big Room houses a nursery colony of
                <i>Myotis velifer</i> during the summer.
                Tours limited to 17 day, max 15 persons.
            </p>
