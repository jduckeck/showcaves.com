        <p>
            <b>Ruby Falls</b> is a show cave located inside Lookout Mountain, which is famous for its huge underground waterfall of the same name.
            It is very popular and has more than 400,000 visitors per year.
            Despite the location in Lookout Mountain it is not Lookout Mountain Cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The original <b>Lookout Mountain Cave</b> had a natural entrance on the banks of the Tennessee River at the foot of Lookout Mountain.
            It was known for centuries, first used as a campsite by American Indians, later a hideout for outlaws and a Civil War Hospital.
            Many visitors left their traces, and there is a signature of <b class="smallCaps">Andrew Jackson</b> who also visited the cave.
            This natural entrance was permanently sealed by a railroad tunnel built by the Southern Railway in 1905.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b class="smallCaps">Leo Lambert</b>, a local cave enthusiast, tried to open the historic Lookout Mountain Cave to the public again.
            In 1923, he formed a corporation for this purpose and purchased land above the cave.
            In 1928, a site for an lift shaft into the original cave was selected and drilling began.
            After some time, when the shaft reached a depth of 79 m, a small crevice was opened, 60 cm wide and 1.20 m high.
            Mr. <b class="smallCaps">Lambert</b> immediately decided to explore it and spent 17 hours on his first exploration trip.
            He came back with a description of a cave with beautiful formations and an amazing 46 m high waterfall, located 335 m inside Lookout Mountain.
            On his second trip he was accompanied by his wife <b class="smallCaps">Ruby Lambert</b>.
            On this trip he named the waterfall, after his wife, <b>Ruby Falls</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Mr. <b class="smallCaps">Lambert</b> decided to develop both caves and to offer two caves tours.
            After 92 days of work, day and night, the lift shaft finally reached the original cave.
            After installing the lift and preparing the paths of the original cave it was opened to the public in 1929.
            Development continued in the new cave and 1930 the second tour to Ruby Falls was also opened to the public.
            At first the two caverns were shown on separate tours, but the popularity of the falls far exceeded that of the lower cave and that trip was discontinued in 1935.
            For many years the lift was still going down to the old cave, and it was possible for researchers and cavers to visit the cave.
            In 2006 the old lift was replaced by a new one, which ends at Ruby Falls Cave.
            As the old lift was sealed for security reasons, the original Lookout Mountain Cave is not accessible any more.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The entrance building looks like a 15th century Irish castle and is called <b>Cavern Castle</b>.
            It was constructed from limestone excavated from the lift shaft.
            Designed by Chattanooga architect <b class="smallCaps">R. H. Hunt</b> it was built in 1929.
            The castle was the community’s social gathering hub with a fashionable tearoom.
            Today it contains a Visitor Center with a small exhibition on cave formation and speleothems.
            And there is the Castle Cafe, which offers a seasonal menu and local craft beer on tap.
            It’s possible to visit the café without paying an entrance fee.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is actually more like a theme park, as it includes the vast park, the Lookout Mountain Tower with its panoramic views of the Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee River.
            There is another outlook which is called <b>Blue Heron Overlook</b> with its red-green true-color colorblind viewfinder.
            It allows people with colorblindness to see a wider range of vibrant, true colors.
            It also offers a zip line and climbing tower.
            The regular cave tour takes only an hour, but most people spend two to three hours at the site.
            We’re not sure if it’s a “long Covid” case, but the tickets are only sold online, you have to buy them in advance and be there on time.
            Walk up tickets are not sold any more.
            This has another drawback, they actually do not provide open hours any more, if you want to know their open hours you have to select the day on the online booking system.
            As far as we understand regular tours are available all year.
            There are also special tours which are mor expensive and which are available only on certain days of the week and early in the morning or late in the evening.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>History Tour</b> is more or less a normal waterfall tour, but the senior guide will tell stories about legendary events and happenings during almost 100 years of history.
            Also guided by senior guides is <b>Gentle Walking Tour</b>, the main idea is a smaller number of participants, very gentle pace and extra time at the waterfall following the light show.
            The <b>Lantern Tour</b> is done by the light of hand-held oldtimer lanterns.
            And around Valentine’s Day the <b>Romance at Ruby</b> tours are offered, obviously only for couples.
        </p>
