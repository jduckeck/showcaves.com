            <b>Penn’s Cave</b> was named after <b class="smallCaps">John Penn</b>, the nephew <b class="smallCaps">William Penn</b>, who founded the colony of Pennsylvania.
            The tour is rather unique, as it is made completely by boat.
            It is said to be <i>America’s only all-water cavern</i>.
            The main cave passage is filled by a rather silent cave river.
            The tour is made by flat-bottom motorboats, which accommodate 22 persons.
            48 steps lead down to the jetty, which is right inside the cave portal.
            The river is only about 1 to 1.5 m deep, but it has a flow of 41,000 m³ daily or 481 l/s.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave was known to the local tribe of the native American, the <b>Seneca Indians</b>.
            Arrowheads, pottery and beads have been found in the cave entrance.
            They called the river from the cave <b>Karoondinha</b>.
            On early maps the river was called <b>Big Mahany</b>, later <b>John Penn’s Creek</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There are many legends about Penn’s Cave, most of them told by <b class="smallCaps">Henry W. Shoemaker</b> (*1880-✝1958), state historian and tale-teller, in his book.
            The most famous story, though fictional, is the legend of the Indian maiden <b class="smallCaps">Nita-nee</b>.
        </p>

        <div class="foreign">

            <p>
                <b class="smallCaps">Malachi Boyer</b>, a young Frenchmen from Lancaster County, explored the wilderness.
                Once in April, he camped at Mammoth Spring, close to the Indian camp of Chief <b class="smallCaps">O-Ko-Cho</b>, on the shores of Spring Creek near Bellefonte.
                He saw <b class="smallCaps">Nita-nee</b>, the beautiful daughter of <b class="smallCaps">O-Ko-Cho</b>, washing a deerskin in the stream.
                They immediately fell in love with each other.
                The Indians would not permit their marriage, so they decided to run away.
                But they were captured by the seven brothers of <b class="smallCaps">Nita-nee</b> and returned to Chief <b class="smallCaps">O-Ko-Cho</b>.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                <b class="smallCaps">O-Ko-Cho</b> told his sons to thrust him into a nearby cavern, filled with water (Penn’s Cave).
                They guarded the entrance, so he tried to find another entrance.
                After swimming around in the water for a week he died because of exhaustion.
                As he did not want the Indians to see him die, he crawled into one of the furthermost recesses of the cavern.
                They later found him and weighted the body with stones before they dropped it in the deepest water in the cavern.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Until today, on still summer nights, a sound like "Nita-nee - Nita-nee" rings through the cavern.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Old legend.
            </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            In 1855 the farm with the cave was rented to <b class="smallCaps">Jacob Harshbarger</b> by the owner <b class="smallCaps">Samuel Vantries</b>.
            <b class="smallCaps">Harshbarger</b> had his own story about the first European to enter the cave:
            <b class="smallCaps">James Martin</b> from Ireland was an honor graduate of Trinity College in Dublin, and pastor of the Presbyterian congregation in Penns Valley.
            He entered the cave, and caught a cold in the cave from which he never fully recovered, until he died in 1795.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave was developed by <b class="smallCaps">Jesse</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Samuel Long</b>.
            Their father had been against "pleasure-seekers entering the cave", but they realized the financial possibilities of a show cave.
            They built <b>Penn’s Cave House</b> and a large boat, and began charging admission to the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            After some wrong financial decisions, they had to sell the cave and hotel to <b class="smallCaps">H.C.</b> and <b class="smallCaps">R.P. Campbell</b>.
            They further developed the cave and made it one of the unique resorts in central Pennsylvania.
            Because of the increasing number of automobiles in the beginning of the 20th century and the increasing tourism, the number of cave visitors increased continually.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tour is made on boats with motors, when the guide wants to talk to the group he turns off the motor.
            Then the boat silently floats on the about one metre deep silent river.
            There are stops at several huge chambers, which sometimes have a dry floor with stalagmites on one side.
            Between chamber two and three are <b>The Chimes</b>, a group of several stalactites which can be reached from the boat.
            Between 1885 and 1967 they were hit with a wooden mallet by the guides, who played a short melody on the stalactites.
            The characteristic sounds are in general characterized as "hollow" sounds, so the guides told the visitors the formation was hollow.
            Such a practice tends to destroy the speleothems, when a guide strikes a little too hard, or when cracks form and become bigger and bigger, at one point the <i>pipes</i> start to break off.
            This was the reason why this bad habit was finally stopped.
        </p>
