        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Despite the historic name <b>McConnell Springs</b>, this place is not simply a
            spring but a location of various karst features including sinks, dolines, and
            springs.
            It is a karst valley, probably a collapsed cave, which is about 10m deeper than
            the surrouding landscape.
            There is a series of three springs and swallow holes, the water of the cave
            river reappears three times until it finally disappears.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This place is eclosed by a road and industrial development.
            It was almost forgotten in the mid 20th century and in a pretty bad shape, but
            has recently ben restored by the work of a non-profit organization.
            However, the public interest, the donations and the volunteer work is definitely
            primarly a result of the historic importance of the place, not of the karst
            geologic importance.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In the 1770s Kentucky started to attract frontiersmen.
            In 1774 Virginia Governor Lord <b class="smallCaps">Dunmore</b> created a peace
            with the local native Indians after the so-called <b>Dunmore's War</b>.
            Among the first was in 1775 the party of <b class="smallCaps">William
            McConnell</b> and some fellows from Pennsylvania.
            When they heard about the Revolutionary War, they named the place in honor of
            the city of Lexington, Massachusetts, where the war had started.
            So this is actually the place where the city of Lexington, Kentucky, received
            its name.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            So this place was always a central part of the town.
            The water was used for a mill, a distillery, a gunpowder factory, and a dairy
            farm.
            But when the city grew it was almost forgotten and surrounded by the growing
            industrial plants.
            Probably the only reason why it was never used for development was the
            difficulty to build on the slopes of the valley.
            The costs were simply too high.
            The karst features were not destroyed, but unfortunately they did not remain
            untouched.
            Cleanups of the site in the late 1970s sponsored by the Lexington Environmental
            Comission resulted in hundreds of large truck loads of trash which were removed.
            More than 400 tires were found at the bottom of the springs and removed.
            And the volunteers learned about the beauty of the place and returned regularly,
            the interest of the people in the place increased.
            Finally the <b>Friends of McConnell Springs</b> were founded, a group dedicated
            to the protection of the site.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Today an educational center exists on a piece of buildable land adjacent to the
            karst area.
            A boardwalk was built along the river and allows visitors to see the springs and
            swallow holes with minimal damage to the environment.
            The springs have become a recreational and environmental education park in the
            middle of an industrial area.
            It is a historical site of interest and also a natural park.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The first spring of the cave river is the <b>Blue Hole</b>, named after its deep
            blue colour.
            The water is some three meters deep, and the limestone rich water filters the
            sunlight and gets the typical blue colour.
            The deep conical basin of the spring is a result of the force of the water,
            which discharges from a fissure in the bedrock with some force, blowing away the
            overlying sediments.
            The <b>Boil</b> is the second big spring of the park, named after a typical
            effect after heavy rains.
            The production of the springs grows rapidly and the enormous amount of water
            emerging from the cave below has a high pressure and causes fountain-like
            columns up to half a metre tall, which look like the water was boiling.
            This is called an artesian spring, as the pressure in the ground water body is
            high and forces the water out.
            The <b>Final Sink</b> is nothing less than this.
            It is simply the place were the water finally leaves the surface inside the park
            to flow underground.
            The next 500m of the waterfilled cave are still unexplored, but the water then
            reappears in <b>Preston's Cave</b>.
            It finally flows into Elkhorn Creek.
