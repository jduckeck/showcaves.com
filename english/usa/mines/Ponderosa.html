        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Ponderosa Saloon Mine</b> is a gold and silver mine located below Ponderosa Saloon in downtown Virginia City.

        <!-- This is family fun for everyone in the heart of See
        the complete underground mine workings of an authentic . Experienced miners will
        guide you through tunnels as you descend deep into the shaft. You will see the
        actual tunnels, crosscuts, drifts and various tools that the miners used in the
        old Comstock. One can experience what life was really like for these men as they
        lived their short and hard lives hundreds of feet below the earth. Admission for
        adults is $4 and $1.50 for children under 12.

        The Ponderosa Saloon in Virginia City is home to an underground mine tour.

        Virginia City's Best and Belcher Mine makes more money today than it ever did
        when it operated as a mine more than a century ago. Tourists, however, are the
        reason the mine is lucrative these days.

        The Best and Belcher is one of the best examples of a mine that was a genuine
        money pit. Established in 1869, the mine's shaft was located between the
        fabulously rich Gould and Curry and Consolidated Virginia mines.

        More than $1.6 million was spent developing the Best and Belcher. But despite
        nearly 40 years of digging, dynamiting, timbering and drilling, the mine was
        never as profitable as surrounding mines and was finally abandoned in 1917.

        About 30 years ago, however, the owners of the Ponderosa Saloon in Virginia
        City, which is located in the historic Bank of California offices, discovered
        that the old Best and Belcher shaft ran through the hillside behind the
        building, which had been built in 1864.

        A horizontal tunnel was dug from the rear of the saloon into the old shaft and
        opened for tours. Since then, thousands of visitors have walked the 315 feet
        from the saloon into the shaft and caught a glimpse of Comstock history.

        The Ponderosa Mine Tour is one of the best ways to get an up close look at the
        source of Virginia City's fame and success. You catch the tour in a waiting room
        just beyond the saloon's wooden bar.

        During a recent visit, the guide, who wore a protective helmet (mostly for
        effect), began the tour by ushering us through metal doors into a timbered map
        room. Pointing to a large underground map of the area, he explained how Virginia
        City is crisscrossed with old mine shafts and noted that if all were placed end
        to end they would stretch more than 750 miles.

        From the map room, we moved into a dirt tunnel (wear shoes that you don't mind
        getting muddy) that led into the heart of the Best and Belcher shaft. We passed
        an old powder room, which still contained a few old, wooden dynamite boxes.

        The guide said that during the 1870s Virginia City's miners were the highest
        paid miners in the world, making $4 a day (the equivalent of about $230 a day
        today).

        Near the end of the tunnel, we were told that we were about 52 feet underground
        and that the temperature year-round is a cool 50 degrees. The guide walked to a
        partially caved-in ventilation tunnel, which he said was the original entrance
        to the shaft, and lit a small candle.

        He extinguished the electric lights and showed us what it was like to work in
        the mine during the 1870s. The single candle barely illuminated his face, let
        alone much of the shaft.

        Smiling, he said the biggest problem for the miners was a sudden breeze coming
        in from the ventilation shaft and blowing out the candle. Then, of course, blew
        out the candle.

        After flicking the overheads back on, he added that sometimes miners would bring
        canaries in small cages down into the mines with them. If the bird suddenly
        died, it was a sign that the air was bad from methane gas, and the miners would
        quickly exit.

        And from here, so did we.


        The Best and Belcher mine tour is offered daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission
        is $4.50 for adults and $1.50 for children under 12. The Ponderosa is located on
        C Street in Virginia City. For more information call 775-847-0757.----Richard

        You can tour the Chollar Mine, which is located off the main street in town. Or,
        you can take the Ponderosa Saloon Mine Tour. This tour actually travels back in
        one of the Best & Belcher mine's tunnels right under the town, and you will get
        an excellent look at how the miner's toiled in these dark, musty tunnels for the
        grand sum of $4 per day. The tour is guided by a local expert and lasts about 20
        minutes. You can take the tour daily 10 AM to 6PM, and I highly recommend it.
