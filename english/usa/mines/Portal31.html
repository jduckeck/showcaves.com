        <h2>Geology</h2>

        <p>
            The main seam mined here was numbered <b>C</b>.
            It was also called <b>Benham</b>, <b>Keokee</b>, <b>Taggart</b>, and <b>Roda</b>
            seam.
            It is mostly 1.6m thick and is considered one of the best gas and coking coals
            in the United States.

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Portal 31</b> is a huge coal mine, which was prepared as a show mine with
            enormous efforts.
            The $2.5 million project took decades and included an enormous effort to make
            the tour safe.
            The tour is limited to areas of the mine that have proven safe over nearly 90
            years.
            The overhead rock layers were secured with roof bolts and a super-strength metal
            mesh.
            Tunnel walls were covered with a sealant and unused mine tunnels were sealed off
            to keep methane gases out.
            The mining train was equipped with an overhead metal cab against rock falls.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The mine tour is fully automated, visitors enter railcars and are carried
            through the mine.
            At eight stops animatronic miners explain the way the coal was mined.
            A robotic miner, his <i>son</i> and <i>grandson</i> tell the story of the
            evolution of mining over generations.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Portal 31</b> was named after its entrance, which was just numbered.
            The mine and the surrounding infrastructure were constructed during World War I.
            The village Lynch was created by the <b>U.S. Steel Coal and Coke Co.</b> in 1917
            on an area of 40,000 acres of land they had bought.
            It was named for the company's first president, <b class="smallCaps">Thomas
            Lynch</b>.
            The mine was developed with an enormous size, more than 1 million tons of coal
            per year were mined through Portal 31.
            In the early 1920s a tipple was built, which is the place where the coal is
            loaded onto rail cars.
            At this time the tipple of Lynch was the largest in the world.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The mine provided work for almost three generations.
            Working conditions were comparably good in the new mine, the seam was 1.80m
            thick and so was the mine.
            Savety was a general principle during the mine worked.
            Nevertheless there were certain dangers mining coal, especially the gas which
            was highly dangerous and caused nausea and explosions.
            In the early years the proverbial canary in a coal mine was used to detect the
            gas.
            Later modern sensors were used.
            Nevertheless there were accidents and miners died in this mine.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The mine tour is completed by a musem, which is called <b>Lamphouse Museum</b>.
            It may also be visited without a mine tour.
            It exhibits the the tools used by the miners, and many memorabilia.
            The museum is named after the building it is located at, the <b>Lamphouse No
            2</b>.
            The lamphouse was providing light for the miners, it was used to store and
            refill the headlamps.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This mine is rather new and the locals hope it will draw many visitors into the
            area.
            Actually it was a huge investment as several million dollars were spent for the
            savety measures and the animatronic.
            And it took much longer than anticipated, as the opening was delayed several
            times, the original schedule said 2005 and it was finally opened in 2009.
            The result is both unique and strange, a sort of coal mining theme park and
            underground roller coaster ride.
            We guess every visitor has to decide for himself if it is worth the fee.
        </p>
