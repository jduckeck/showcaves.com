        <h2>Geology</h2>

        <p>
            There is a band of gold-bearing rocks which were formed over 600 million years
            ago by volcanic activity.
            It runs from northern Virginia to eastern Alabama and is known as the
            <b>Carolina Slate Belt</b>.
            In western South Carolina it is known as <b>Western Piedmont gold fields</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Today the gold field is depleted, but small amounts of gold are still found in
            all streams near McCormick as placer deposits.
        </p>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Heritage Gold Mine Park</b> is located at the former site of the <b>Dorn's
            Mine</b> in McCormick.
            Both names are strongly related to the mining history of South Carolina.
            Actually there was not much mining in South Carolina, but there is a belt of
            gold bearing rocks crossing the state.
            In the mid 19th century several mines tried to mine some gold, but most of them
            were not very productive.
            But Dorn's Mine was the most productive mine of the area, producing 44,000
            ounces of gold during its operation.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b class="smallCaps">Billy Dorn</b> was a farmer, who was hooked by the prospect
            to find gold.
            He leased land for gold exploration which he payed with borrowed money.
            And finally all collapsed, but only three days before he would have loosed all
            he owned, he discovered a vein of gold just under the surface at Peak Hill.
            According to legend he was hunting with his foxhounds, and the dogs were
            scratching the ground, so Dorn could see the gold vein.
            The land was owned by Dr. <b class="smallCaps">John Wayland Hearst</b>, and Dorn
            purchased it in 1853 from Hearst.
            He used slaves from his farm to create a 100m long trench, 5m wide and 3m deep,
            where he mined the gold open cats.
            The trench is visible until today.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Dorn made a small fortune in just one year.
            He paid USD 1,200 for the land and extracted gold for USD 300,000.
            Then he sold the mine to the New Yorker <b class="smallCaps">William Lloyd</b>
            for only USD 17,000, but also for a share of profits.
            Lloyd managed the mine for the next 10 years, 125 tunnels were dug, totaling
            7,200m.
            With his money Dorn purchased land and slaves to mine the gold.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            On 16-AUG-1855 Dorn (56) marrried 15 year old <b class="smallCaps">Martha Jane
            Rutledge</b> and they had eight children over the course of 18 years.
            He used his money to support the Confederacy in the Civil War.
            He actually outfittted an entire Confederate regiment, the Fifteenth South
            Carolina Infantry Regiment ("Dorn's Invincibles").
            But at the end of the war he lost his free slave labor, and couldn't afford to
            pay them as miners.
            So he closed all his mines.
            He was almost broke, because he cantinually spent all his money.
            He earned a little for leases, several companies believed they could still find
            more gold, but the mines were almost depleted.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            An investment group headed by <b class="smallCaps">Cyrus McCormick</b> invested
            in the mines in 1869 and finally buys them in 1871.
            But the gold is almost depleted and so they closed the mines 1883.
            He auctioned a part of the land off for the construction of a city, which was
            later named after him.
            McCormick also invested in two railroad companies, the <b>Greenville and Augusta
            Railroad</b>, and the <b>Savannah Valley Railroad</b>.
            He convinced them to build a connection line which met at the town.
            As a result the economy of the town increased and he was able to sell even more
            ground after he closed the mines, so his investment payed off.
        </p>
