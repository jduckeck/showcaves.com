<h2>Geology</h2>

<p>
Again a typical gold deposit, with placer gold in the valley floor, which were
mined first.
Later the miners followed the trail of gold to its source in the mountain.
The gold bearing quartz vein was mined, which was called <b>hard rock lode
mining</b>.
</p>


<br clear="all">



<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The <b>Argo Gold Mill</b> is pretty prominent with its huge red buildings.
They were built before 1900 to process the gold bearing ore from various mines
of the area.
Most of those mines were connected with the mill through the Argo Tunnel, which
was completed in 1900 after 17 years of work.
The 7.5km long adit was built for water drainage, ventilation, and economical
transportation of the gold bearing ore.
The tour includes a visit to the adit, the Double Eagle gold mine and the mill.
There is a live demonstration of the crushing, milling and rock drilling.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Idaho Springs is the location of the great Rocky Mountain goldrush.
Is was started when <b class="smallCaps">George A. Jackson</b> made the first
discovery of gold in January 1859.
Almost overnight 50,000 men poured into Clear Creek Canyon.
Between 1859 to 1861 more than 13,000 mining claims were recorded.
After the placer gold was worked out, the miners searched for the gold bearing
vein and started the so caled <b>hard rock lode mining</b>.
In 1902 more than 300 mines were operated in the Idaho Spring area.
Many successful mines were on Seaton Mountain between Idaho Springs and Central
City.
Quartz Hill was home of the Glory Hole, called the <i>richest square mile on
earth</i>.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
But the miners had the same problems as always: increasing depth and increasing
problems with water in the mines.
The solution was the same as hundreds of years before: an adit.
Adits are tunnels which are built from the mine to a deep valley nearby.
It the valley is deeper than the mine, the water may just flow out without the
need to pump it to the surface.
Also the ore may be carried out this way, as an ore railway would also go
downhill, without the need to lift the ore to the surface.
Such an adit was the Argo Tunnel, 3.60m wide with two railway tracks and a
drainage ditch in the center.
The second half was only half the diameter, as the need was less towards the
end.
The tunnel has a .3 downhill grade, which was enough for the water to drain the
water.
It ran across Virginia Canyon, Gilpin Gulch, Russel Gulch, Quartz Hill,
Nevadaville, and Central City.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<b class="smallCaps">Samuel Newhouse</b>, <b class="smallCaps">Thomas Weir</b>
and <b class="smallCaps">John Montgomery</b> formed a partnership in Leadville.
They formed a corporation to sell stock and raise the money needed for the adit,
which was the largest mining project in the world and when it was completed the
longest tunnel in the world.
The tunnel was dug using hand drill and hammer for the holes and black powder.
But at this time pneumatic drills were be developed and soon used at the tunnel.
The first drills were pretty dangerous, so they were called <b>Widow Makers</b>.
Soon they were modified and became safer.
Dynamite became available and electricity introduced at Idaho Springs, the mules
which pulle dthe carts were repaced by  electric locomotives.
The construction speed of the tunnel increased cantinually and the miners were
setting new records for the amount of blasted rock.
The adit was finally completed in 1910.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The Argo Mill at the tunnel entrance was built by <b class="smallCaps">R.E.
Shimer</b> who had bought the Argo Reduction and Ore Purchasing Company before.
He created one of the largest and most modern three hundred ton mills in the
United States.
The ore was delivered by the miner cars to 50 ton storage bins, from where an
electric belt conveyor transported the ore to the chain bucket elevator.
It raised the to the top of the mill where a big stamp mill pulverized the ore.
The precious metals were extracted by the addition of ammonium salts.
Then came amalgamation, flotation, a cyanide process, and gravity systems.
