        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Seldom Seen Tourist Coal Mine</b> represents a rather small mine, but it is
            relatively intact and complete, so visitors can see any aspect of Pennsilvania
            coal mining.
            This is the former <b>Miller Run no. 8</b> mine, which was purchased by <b
                class="smallCaps">Andrew Radomsky</b> in 1940.
            He also bought <b>Miller Run no. 7</b> only a few hundred meters away, and
            operated both mines together.
            The installation of new machinery in the early 1940s brought an increase in
            production, and the high time of the mine was during the late fourties.
            In the late fifties and the early sixties the production was only half as big,
            but it was more or less constant.
            Then the mine was transformed into a tourist mine and soon after the coal mining
            was shut down.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            As the mine never was closed, all the equipment necessary for coal mining is
            still there and working.
            This make the mine one of the most complete mines in the area, and despite the
            small size visitor can see extremly well how coal was mined in Pennsylvania.
            There are remains of the time when the mine was operated by mule haulage.
            There are pumps, battery powered locomotive, wall cutter, trolley system and
            conveyor system to be seen.
            The train that once carried the miners into the mine, now transports the
            tourists to the working face.
            Here the guides demonstrate the equipment and explain the <b>pillar and
            stall</b> method of working the mine.
            The sound of the conveyor belt together with the noise from the cutting
            equipment gives a modern day impression of Dante's Inferno.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A special thing with this mine, is that it is haunted.
            Every year during the last three weeks of October, there are ghosts in the mine.
            Only the extremely brave visitor are able to visit the mine then.
            How the ghosts got into the mine tells the following story.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In 1901, on a dark October night, the desolate farmhouse of the widow <b
                class="smallCaps">Barbara Yahner</b> was invaded by six masked men.
            The burglars broke the door of the house and Mrs. <b
                class="smallCaps">Yahner</b> heard this.
            Her oldest son, <b class="smallCaps">Ambrose Yahner</b>, awoke and looked for
            his father's pistol.
            The thieves went upstairs, Ambrose rushed into the hall and fired six shots.
            It seems he was not too good with the pistol, as he wounded only one of the
            intruders.
            His pistol was now empty, and he was badly outnumbered by the thieves, so he was
            easily overcome.
            The burglars bound and gagged the entire family.
            They searched the house for valuables and blew the family safe with TNT.
            They left with the family's priceless jewels and an undetermined amount of cash.
            Next day <b class="smallCaps">Edward Spates</b>, <b class="smallCaps">John
            Glover</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Charles Kreb</b> were charged with the
            crime.
            But the bandits had been masked, none of the victims could positively identify
            them, so they got away with their crime.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Now the spooky part: <b class="smallCaps">Spates</b>, <b
                class="smallCaps">Glover</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Krebs</b> were never seen
            again after the trial.
            Is is said that the three met with their accomplices.
            They went into Seldom Seen Mine to hide their booty, but a cave-in buried the
            robbers alive.
            And still, somewhere deep in the mine, are the robber's bodies and their loot.
            Their ghosts desperately try to dig out their buried treasure.
        </p>
