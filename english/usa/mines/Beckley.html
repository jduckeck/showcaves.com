        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Beckley Exhibition Coal Mine</b> is a typical coal mine of West Virginia, and
            there are still various operating mines.
            In 2006 the number of visitor boasted because of a tragic mining accidents at
            two other mines.
            The death of 14 miners was covered in newspapers all over the world, and so many
            people tried to learn more about coal mining at this show mine.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This mine has been the place of filming activities.
            Scenes of the movie <b>Matewan</b>, a film about the bloody battle to unionize a
            coal mine, were filmed here.
            It was also featured on a <b>Discovery Channel</b> documentation.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Beckley Coal Mine was mined mostly between the 1880s and 1910, and thus the
            shown technology is of that era.
            There are open carbide lamps and also security lamps, which do not ignite
            methane gas but show its presence.
            Gas was the biggest danger in a coal mine, and so the <b>fireboss</b> had to
            walk the whole mine daily to make sure it was safe for the crew.
            The coal was mined manually, and every worker filled his own cart.
            Then he marked his cart with a round metal tag, and sent it out.
            The tags were collected and counted, and the miner was paid 20 cents for a cart.
            With about 10 carts per days he earned 2 dollars daily, whch was not too bad for
            the turn of the 20th century.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Coal mines are rather dangerous, as the coal produces inflamable gases,
            especially methane.
            As soon as there is an igniting flame, for example the miners lamp, there will
            be an explosion.
            The job of the fireboss was to walk the complete miner daily and check for
            gases, before the men entered the mine.
            This was pretty dangerous but also well payed.
            Safety lamps, where the flame was covered by a wire mesh, did not ignite the
            gas, the mesh cooled down the temperature until it was too low.
            But the gas caused the colour of the flame to change.
            The fireboss hat to check the colour of the light continually while he was
            walking the mine, and to avoid any other spark.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At the end of the tour a more modern part of the mine is reached.
            The timber struts are replaced by steel plates and bolts, and there are the
            first machines to help cutting the coal.
            When the mines were modernized, they started to pay the miners by the hour
            instead of paying by the amount of coal.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The show mine was closed for more than one year between 2007 and March 2009.
            A new visitors center was be built, with 1,300m&sup2; of space for exhibits, a
            replica of a coal company store and an extensive collection of coal camp
            artifacts.
            Other parts of the 3.5 Million Dollar modernization are a new parking lot,
            pedestrian areas and outdoor exhibits.
