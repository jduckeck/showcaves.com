        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Hocking Hills State Park</b> is located in the picturesque sandstone region
            of southeastern Ohio, a landscape of towering cliffs, waterfalls and deep
            hemlock-shaded gorges.
            Rock outcrops are sculptured by the forces of erosion, especially rivers and
            frost, and form shelters and caves.
            Such sandstone caves are rare and generally very small.
            This ones are not small, and there is even a "real cave" called <b>Rock
            House</b>, which means it is not just an overhanging cliff face, but a passage
            with walls on both sides.
            All the caves at Hocking Hills State Park are well developed in terms of
            picknick areas.
            However, they are not at all developed as show caves.
            This is not necessary, as generally a torch is not needed, and hiking shoes are
            a good idea anyway in a park with so many interesting trails.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The gorges and caves are carved into the <b>Blackhand sandstone</b>, 350 million
            years old delta sediments of a river.
            At this point a huge river met the warm shallow sea which covered most of Ohio
            at that time.
            The river brought sand with him and deposited it in its estuary.
            This formed a layer which is today 50m thick.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Old Man's Cave</b> is located in Old Man's Gorge, a 500m long sandstone
            gorge.
            This gorge starts with the Upper Falls and ends at the Lower Falls, with many
            nice spots in between, like Devil's Bathtub, the lookout at Sphinx Head or, of
            course Old Man's Cave.
            There is a round trip trail on top of the cliff and a trail along the bottom, a
            frame bridge across the gorge and varios tunnels leading down into the gorge.
            The Visitor Center is located at Old Man's Cave and is the obvious starting
            point for hikes.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Old Man's Cave</b> was obviously first known to the native Indians who lived
            here.
            Two brothers, <b class="smallCaps">Nathaniel</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Pat
            Rayon</b> came to the area in 1795.
            They built a permanent cabin 10m north of the cave entrance, both are buried in
            or near the cave.
            The cabin was later relocated on the nearby Iles farm to be used as a tobacco
            drying house.
            Later <b class="smallCaps">Richard Rowe</b> lived in the gorge.
            His family moved from the Cumberland Mountains of Tennessee to the Ohio River
            Valley around 1796 and established a trading post.
            He was hunting with his two dogs along the Scioto River, and discovered the
            Hocking Region on a side trip up Salt Creek.
            Rowe lived in the area and is buried beneath the ledge of the main recess cave.
            While he lived here, the cave was named <b>Old Man's Cave</b> because of him.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Ash Cave</b> contained a strange heap of ash, when it was first discovered by
            white settlers, hence the name.
            There were several heaps of ash, the biggest was 35m long and 10m wide, 1m high.
            It is not clear where those ashes originated from, but there are several
            theories.
            Some say it were accumulated ashes of Indian campfires, other say the results of
            smelting silver or lead by the Indians.
            Another theory say that its a result of making saltpeter in the cave.
            An excavation of the ash in 1877 revealed various Indian remains like arrows,
            animal bones in great variety, bits of pottery, flints and corn cobs.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Ash Cave</b> looks very impressive, and is the largest recess cave in the
            state.
            It is reached through a 400m long narrow gorge, which suddenly opens up.
            The cave is a huge ledge forming a shelter, 30m deep and 27m high, continuing
            for 215m along the gorge wall.
            Today the floor is level and covered with sand.
            The concave geometry of the cave does a special accoustic trick: there are two
            distant points in the cave where you can talk to someone in the other point by
            whisper and be understood.
            This so-called <b>whispering gallery</b> is a result of of sound waves being
            reflected and concentrated, similar to a lens.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Rock House</b> is said to be the only true cave in the park.
            It is not a recess cave, but a straight underground passage, 7.50m high, between
            6m and 9m wide, and 60m long.
            It was formed by water leaking through a joint running parallel to the cliff
            face, which is visible in the ceiling of the passage.
            Orthogonal joint, between the cave and the cliff face, resulted in huge
            window-like openings.
            The seven windows look Gothic-arched and the massive sandstone columns inbetween
            support the roof.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Rock House was used as a shelter for a very long time.
            Troughs or holding tanks were chiseled out of the stone floor to collect ground
            water pouring out of the sandstone.
            Small recesses in the back wall were used as ovens.
            Later it was frequented by robbers, horse thieves, murderers and even
            bootleggers, which resulted in the name <b>Robbers Roost</b>, at least according
            to local legends.
            In the 19th century it became a famous tourist destination, which resulted in a
            development of the area.
            In 1835, Colonel <b class="smallCaps">F.F. Rempel</b> erected a 16-room hotel
            where the picnic shelter is today.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The early tourists left numerous dated carvings in the soft rock.
            The most interesting one is an open book with the letters <b>ITFBRAR -
            ITFFAWMTAW</b> written on its pages.
            This is the abbreviation of <b>In the fall, Buck Run bananas are ripe - in the
            frost fall, a wise man takes a wife</b>.
            <i>Buck Run banana</i> is a local slang term for the fruit of the pawpaw tree.
        </p>
