        <p>
            <b>Pettyjohn Cave</b> is a well-known wild cave with a lot of traffic.
            It is what is called a <i>sacrifice cave</i>, a cave which is more or less officially open to cave trekkers and thus protecting other caves around by drawing the whole traffic to this spot.
            So that is what you will find in this rather large (3rd largest cave in Georgia) and varied cave: crawling, stooping, mud, some rather easy climbs, narrow parts and some speleothems.
            And of course many other cave trekkers.
            The most frequented parts show rocks which are polished shiny and slick by too many visitors crawling across.
            Because of its size the cave is rather interesting and despite the high number of visitors well worth a visit.
            The entrance chamber, which is quite spacey, is heavily vandalized.
            From here only narrow crawl passages follow and the number of visitors is dramatically reduced.
            A small chamber with a waterfall is the destination of the remaining cave trekkers, after that its like any other cave only frequented by caver.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Pettyjohn Cave</b> was named after <b class="smallCaps">John Pettyjohn</b>, who originally owned the land.
            Before it was also known as <b>Wilson’s Cave</b>.
            For some reason the cave is spelled wrong on various internet pages, mostly as <i>Petty John’s Cave</i>, but we also discovered <i>Pettijohn’s Cave</i> and even the semi-French <i>Petit Jean</i>.
            Probably a result of non-cavers hearing the name on a cave trekking trip and later writing some social media comment without knowing how to spell the name.
            Even the Wikipedia page was using the wrong spelling until 2018, the official page of the government still uses the wrong spelling.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Although this cave is considered an easy cave, also called a <i>non-technical cave</i>, as no climbing gear is required, it is not harmless to visit this cave.
            Every year numerous people get hurt in the cave, partly a result of the high numbers of visitors, but most accidents are simply a result of insufficient gear and could have been easily avoided.
            Please do not enter this cave without helmet, gloves, sturdy boots or gum boots, knee protectors and if possible some kind of overall.
            Headlamps are recommended, take spare batteries and a second lamp.
            And the most important: never cave alone and tell somebody where you are going and when you will be back, so he may call the rescue if you get lost or have an accident.
            These are the most basic rules of caving and may prevent you from many uncomfortable hours in the cave or even worse.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is located in the state-owned <b>Crockford-Pigeon Mountain Wildlife Management Area</b> in Walker County, Northwest Georgia.
            This is a wild cave, freely accessible, and there is no entrance fee.
            If you take a tour there is obviously a fee for the guide depending on the operator.
            However, as the cave is located in the Wildlife Management Area a Go Outdoors Georgia Hunting, Fishing or Lands Pass licence is required for going there.
            Tourists should purchase a one-day fishing pass for USD 10, which is the cheapest option.
            If you plan multiple visits to the WMA you might purchase an annual Lands Pass for USD 60.
            For residents its half the price.
            There are numerous caves within the boundaries, the biggest three are <b>Ellison’s Cave</b>, <b>Pettyjohn Cave</b>, and <b>Anderson Spring Cave</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Pettyjohn Cave contains no known unusual geologic or biologic features, which is probably the reason why both the WMA and the local cavers tolerated the use as a sacrifice cave.
            Also, the other caves have technical difficulties which make them dangerous for non-cavers.
            If you go on your own you must sign in with the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, there are several card boxes located in the area close to the cave entrance.
            The positive side effect is that someone will look for you if you get lost, the boxes are checked daily.
            Numerous groups in the area offer guided trips into the cave.
            There is even the possibility to attend a cave tour through meetup.
            It is obviously a good idea to visit the cave with such a tour.
            Such tours should offer additional equipment for rent, information on safe caving, speleothems, and the cave, and of course more fun being in a group sharing the experience.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Pettyjohn Cave is located near the base of the mountain on the eastern slope.
            The entrance is only 1.5 m in diameter and leads down an easy climb for 3 m into the main chamber of the cave, approximately 180 m long, 10 m wide, and 4 to 7 m high.
            The main part of the cave is narrow and low, reached through various crawlways in the floor of the entrance chamber.
            As those crawlways are only known to the organized cavers who have a survey printout, they are normally not visited or vandalized.
            If you plan to visit the crawlways you should download and print the surveys on the CAPS homepage, see link below.
