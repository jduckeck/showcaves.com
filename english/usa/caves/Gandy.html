        <p>
            The <b>Sinks of Gandy</b>, <b>Sinks of Gandy Creek</b>, or simply <b>The Sinks</b> are actually a natural through cave, which is the reason why it is also called the <b>Tunnel of Gandy</b>.
            The Gandy river, which flows through rolling hills of West Virginia reaches a patch of limestone, where it immediately enters a cave and flows underground through the cave for about one kilometre.
            Then it reappears at the other side of the limestone and again flows above ground.
            The term sink sounds like there is something going down, sinking.
            Actually the cave is horizontal and the river enters it through a wide portal, 9 m wide and 4.5 m high.
            This is the so-called upper entrance, the cave is left 830 m northeast, as the crow flies, at the lower entrance.
            The river cave passage is winding, and so it is a little longer, about 910 m.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Gandy Creek was named after <b class="smallCaps">Uriah Gandy</b> (or <b class="smallCaps">Gandee</b>) who settled in the area around 1781.
            And a family legend of the <b class="smallCaps">Gandy</b> family tells that <b class="smallCaps">Samuel Gandy</b> deserted from the Revolutionary Army at Valley Forge.
            Captured, jailed, and sentenced to hang, his brother <b class="smallCaps">Uriah</b> broke him out.
            They escaped to Virginia and used the cave as a hideout.
            Its unclear when the cave was actually discovered, but in 1830 the local settlers were well aware of its existence.
            The first written mention of numerous caves in the area including this one was by Randolph County physician <b class="smallCaps">Benjamin Dolbeare</b> in a letter to the <b>Virginia Historical and Philosophical Society</b> in Richmond.
        </p>

        <p class="foreign">
            Between, what is here called, the Aleghany and Rich Mountains, heads a branch of the dry fork a tributary of Cheat River, a ridge extends itself quiet across, from one mountain to the other, and this branc, after keeping its course about 3 miles runs under this ridge which about ¾ of mile wide at its base, and very high.
            <br>
            <b class="smallCaps">Benjamin Dolbeare</b>, 1834
        </p>

        <p class="">
            There are several minor events connected to the cave, although they are actually not speleologic.
            It is the site of the last known killings of elk by hunters in what is now Randolph County, probably about 1830 and 1835.
            In March 1864, during the Civil War, Eight men of General <b class="smallCaps">Imboden</b>’s Confederate command crossed into neighboring Tucker County where they robbed a general store about three miles from the town of Saint George.
            A Union captain and lieutenant pursued them at in the ensuing shootout three were killed, two captured and the stolen property recovered.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave became widely known when <b class="smallCaps">David Hunter Strother</b> published the story of a pleasure expedition to the region in Harper’s Magazine in 1872 and 1873
            He wrote under the pseudonym <b class="smallCaps">Porte Crayon</b>.
            In the fictional story, a group of Virginia gentlemen organize an expedition and discover the Tunnel of Gandy.
        </p>

        <p class="foreign">
            Looking up the glen, the vista is bright as fairy-land, ending with a distant glimpse of blue hills.
            Turning down stream, a grim, menacing cliff rises square athwart the glen, closing it suddenly and shocking you with its unexpected propinquity.
            At its base is an arched opening fifty feet wide by about twenty in height — a gaping mouth which swallows the little river at a gulp.
            There is no gurgling nor choking, but the stream glides in gently and lovingly, like a young snake running down its mother’s throat to sleep, or simple-hearted Goody Two-shoes entering her grandmother’s chamber.
            Altogether the scene is peculiar and impressive.
            Since Gandy left her mother fountains her course has been exceptionally bright and beautiful.
            Unshadowed by gloomy forests, unvexed by ugly drift wood, the gay brunette has leaped and danced through sun-lit glades, just teased enough by moss-clad rocks and picturesque roots to make her laugh and show her dimples to advantage.
            <br>
            In the midst of her joyous life suddenly the dark cavern yawns before her like the jaws of death.
            Without a doubt or shudder, like an unconscious child she enters smiling upon the untried mysteries of the hidden world.
            <br>
            Wading in some forty or fifty yards, we find the subterranean stream still smooth and practicable, without any roaring or other indication of an interruption in its current.
            But its winding course soon shuts out the daylight, and as we had no torches, no attempt was made to push our explorations further.
            <br>
            It is said that persons have made their way through the tunnel, and the estimated distance from entrance to exit is a mile and a quarter.
            The distance around by the road is about two miles.
            The information on the subject was both vague and meagre, as the mountaineers are usually totally indifferent in regard to these natural curiosities, or superstitiously timid about undertaking an exploration.
            In fact, no one cared to talk about the tunnel of Gandy, and the idea haunted me that there was some mystery connected with the place which made the mountaineers rather avoid the subject.
            <br>
            <b class="smallCaps">David Hunter Strother</b> (1872):
            <b>The Mountains</b>
            Harper’s New Monthly Magazine, 45:358-361, 812, August 1872;
        </p>

        <p class="">
            Although it’s the first description of the cave, it is actually not correct, and he did not cross the cave.
            Nevertheless, the measures he gives are still repeated after 150 years as if they were based on a survey.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is a popular through trip and heavily frequented, some say it is the most visited wild cave in West Virginia.
            Because of the water it is best to wear rubber boots.
            Actually, as this is a water cave which may become very dangerous, so avoid snow melt and heavy rains, keep an eye on the weather forecast.
            We recommend good equipment, several light sources per person, tell someone where you are going, so he may be able to call the cave rescue in time.
            These are basic caving rules, but cave tourists tend to ignore them.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Be aware that the land where the cave is located is private property.
            The land around the upper entrance is owned by the <b class="smallCaps">Teter</b> family, who purchased the land in 1939.
            The land around the downstream entrance is owned by the <b class="smallCaps">Tingler</b> family.
            Both have no problem with people visiting the cave as long as they are respectful.
        </p>
