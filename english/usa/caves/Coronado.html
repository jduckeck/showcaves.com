        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Coronado Cave</b> is a nice wild cave, which is not wild at all.
            A visit is rather easy, but it includes several crawls.
            Old clothes and two lamps per visitor are necessary, helmet, gloves and kneepads
            a good idea.
            A permit from the Visitor Center of the Park is required.
            The cave is reached on a 1.2km hike from the Visitor Center, which leads steep
            uphill to the cave entrance.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave entrance is rather small, partially blocked by large boulders, so it is
            necessary to climb over the huge rocks.
            The cave has only a single main passage of 182m length.
            The floor is sandy and level, inside the cave are no difficulties except some
            crawls.
            The passage is up to 7m high and 25m wide, where it widens to form chambers.
            The cave has several formations, the most prominent is the <b>sentinel</b> of
            the cave, a huge symmetric stalagmite standing in the center of the last
            chamber, an almost circular widening of the passage.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Coronado National Memorial</b> is primarly a historic site.
            The first major exploration of the American Southwest by Europeans was made by
            <b class="smallCaps">Francisco Vasquez de Coronado</b>'s Expedition in 1540.
            Coming from Mexico he tried to find the fabled <b>Seven Cities of Cibola</b>.
            He never found his personal El Dorado, but discovered the Zuni, Hopi, Apache,
            the Pueblo Indians along the Rio Grande River.
            He even reached the Grand Canyon.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The park is also famous for the nature, oak woodland with a variety of plants
            and animals.
            Yucca, Cholla, Beargrass, Bobcats and Mountain Lions are quite common.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In 2006 the cave had to be closed after a week of rainfalls which meant 40cm of
            precipitation, an enormous amount for the dry, semi arid climate of Arizona.
            At first the plark staff was glad to receive rain after a week of zero
            precipitation, and the desert started to green and bloom, the animals were
            coming out of their caves to mate.
            But on 31-JUL-2006 flood like rainfalls of 20cm in one day caused dangerous
            water crossings and rock slides and the park staff was evacuated from the area.
            The trail to the cave was destroyed as debris covered it, like most of the
            trails of the park.
            During one year the trails were cleared, the last one with the most heavy
            damages was the cave trail, which was finally cleared in summer 2007 and
            reopened.
        </p>

        <div class="foreignText">

            <p>
                Coronado National Memorial invites you to explore Coronado Cave as we
                open a temporary trail on August 24th, 2007! The trail to the cave has
                been closed since July 31, 2006 due to extreme flooding and mudslides.
                National Park Service and Student Conservation Corps trail crews have
                been working since May to reconstruct the trail, replacing washed out
                steps and realigning the path so it is less susceptible to flood damage.
                Because of the realignment the trail is slightly longer than it used to
                be. The trail is approximately 2.0 miles round trip with an elevation
                gain of about 500 feet. Because there is still some construction work
                occurring on the trail near the cave, visitors are asked to pay close
                attention to areas that are flagged off and to use areas of the trail
                that have been re-routed around the work zones.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Beginning at the visitor center, the trail to Coronado Cave offers not
                only a great hiking experience, but also an opportunity to do a little
                underground exploration. The limestone that houses Coronado Cave formed
                about 250-300 million years ago when Arizona was covered by a shallow
                sea. Limestone is made of the broken shells and skeletons of ancient
                corals, sponges, shellfish, and other creatures. Coronado Cave is about
                600 feet in length, 20 feet high, and 70 feet wide with several crawl
                ways and passages, none of which are very extensive. The cave includes
                numerous formations including stalagmites, stalactites, columns and
                scallops. Geologist examining the scallops estimate that at one time as
                much as 50,000 gallons of water per minute flowed through the cave from
                east to west!
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Allow two hours for a leisurely hike and visit to the cave. A free
                permit is required to visit the cave and can be obtained at the visitor
                center. Bring water, hiking shoes, and one flashlight per person - two if
                exploring alone. Candles, flares and lanterns are prohibited.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The trail is expected to be fully complete later in the fall.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The National Park Service cares for special places
                saved by the American people so that all may
                experience our heritage.
