        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Lava Beds National Monument</b> covers a geographic area that is pock-marked
            with cinder cones and covered with lava flows.
            The central volcano is called <b>Medicine Lake Volcano</b>, the largest mountain
            in the Cascade Range.
            The monument covers more than 500 lava tubes.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Mushpot Cave</b> is located beneath <b>Indian Well Visitor Center</b>, at the
            southern end of the Monument.
            This tube is lighted during business hours of the visitors center and contains
            exhibits about lava tube geology.
            All other tubes are in a more or less natural state.
        </p>


        <div class="foreignText">

            <p>
                The National Park has done a superb job in organising the Lava Beds for
                tourists. They have produced several free leaflets and there is an
                excellent guide book.
                This gives locations details, surveys and descriptions of the major caves
                that are open to the public. Furthermore, they will lend you one torch
                per person for free, you just have to show your driver's license.
                However, you have to return the torches by 16.30 hours or they will come
                looking for you!
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                There are about 400 known caves in the Monument, many of which do not
                appear on the Park maps given to the public. This is because the
                restricted caves contain fragile ice, bats or even ancient pictographs.
                Trips can be booked, but this must be done well in advance..
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The caves open to the public contain extra-heavy steel stairways to take
                account of overweight visitors. A large number of caves are on the Cave
                Loop. This Loop is a road built over the lava field, so you can drive
                from entrance to entrance. Many of the caves on the Loop consist of the
                same lava tube that has been truncated by internal plugs or by external
                collapses.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Lava Beds Monument is so dry that you get dehydrated just by breathing.
                So carry plenty of drinking water. The lava tubes are very hot, so light
                weight clothing is advised. If you wish to go crawling, and there is
                plenty of opportunity, knee pads are a must, likewise heavy gloves. One
                really powerful lamp per party is useful as the tubes tend to be big and
                the dark rock does not reflect the light.
            </p>

            <h4>Skull Cave</h4>

            <p>
                A simple cave consisting of one massive, 18 metre diametre tube, 60
                meters long with a boulder floor. At the end, a stairway descends 15
                meters past an impressive rock arch, and it is like walking into a
                freezer as there is a thick bed of ice at the bottom.
            </p>

            <h4>Golden Dome Cave</h4>

            <p>
                This is entered via a stairway in a chimney. The Golden Dome itself is
                covered with fungus which is covered with water droplets and glows with a
                golden hue when a light is shone on it. A down-tube leads to a series of
                walking size tubes. An up-tube, going against a refreshing draught leads
                to some crawlways and a shaky, un-marked exit in loose blocks, very close
                to:
            </p>

            <h4>Hopkins Chocolate Cave</h4>

            <p>
                Named originally after the mud in the entrance series, but this is long
                gone and this area is very dry. Some passage are quite low and roots
                appear in places with massive cracks everywhere. In other places, melted
                parts of the ceiling have pealed off leaving behind bubbly craters
                looking exactly like Aero chocolate.
            </p>

            <h4>Upper To Lower Sentinel Cave</h4>

            <p>
                A through trip in a tunnel like passage 3 m wide and 6 m high which
                extends for 200m. There are plenty of side passages. Some of the side
                passages are gated.
            </p>

            <h4>Valentines Cave</h4>

            <p>
                The double entrance is very impressive with neat natural benches running
                along the walls. The first 200 m consist of a 10 m+ lava tube. Named
                after the Ranger who discovered the cave on Valentine's Day when the
                surface temperature was -23°C and the cave was emitting a large
                column of water vapour.
            </p>

            <h4>Catacomb Cave</h4>

            <p>
                The longest cave in the Monument at just over 1.6km. Named after its
                resemblance to the catacombs in Rome - there are a lot of dead end
                alcoves. Knee pads are essential. Near the entrance, the cave forms a
                3D maze on 3 levels. Further in, the cave narrows to two parallel tubes
                which goes for several hundred meters before pinching out. Near the end
                there is a connecting passage for the masochists.
            </p>

        <h4>Fern Cave</h4>

        <p>
            <b>Fern Cave</b> is one of the smallest caves at Lava beds, but probably the
            most interesting and least accessible one too.
            It is closed to the public except for one tour every Saturday.
            It is mandatory to make an reservation for a ranger guided tour, and the number
            of visitors is restricted to six per tour.
            The group rides to the cave on a dirt track for several kilometers, the road and
            the cave are gated since the 1930s, due to some vandalizm.
            Even the the indigneous Modoc who once used this cave and their ancestors who
            still do, are esteemed by a ritual <i>cleanse</i> with the smoke of burning sage
            before entering the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A metall ladder leads down about three meters into the cave.
            In the area directly below the entrance ferns grow because of the humidity of
            the cave, which gave the cave its name.
            The cave was discovered and named by <b class="smallCaps">J.D. Howard</b>, a
            pioneer who explored most of the Lava Beds in the early 20th century.
            Right beneath the ladder are two panels with pictigrams, one shows about five
            pictures and is 1.50m wide, the other is 3m wide and shows 10 pictures.
            The meaning of the symbols is unknown, but there is a theory, that some symbols
            looking like a supernova and a crescent moon depict an astronomical event
            reported around the world in 1054.
            archaeological excavations revealed stone tools, charcoal, obsidian, basket
            fragments and glass beads in the cave sediments.
            A stone pestle and mortar, probably used for grinding paint pigments, is visible
            until today.
