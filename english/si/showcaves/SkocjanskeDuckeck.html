<p>
Following the signs, the visitor arrives at the huge parking lot at Matavun.
Here is a ticket office and some shops, cafes and restaurants.
When you have to wait for your tour, you may consider a short walk to an outlook
at the rim of the huge collapse doline.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The tour starts in front of the ticket office, with a walk of almost 15 minutes
to the nearby doline <b>Globocak</b>.
In summer this walk is rather strenuous and hot, so a hat and sun protection are
a good idea.
While the plateau is rather dry and meagre, the doline itself is covered by
green grass and bushes.
The path goes down to the floor of the large bowl, which was formed by the
collapse of a large chamber of the &#352;kocjanske Jame cave system.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
After the accurate survey of the cave the speleologists discovered, that the dry
branch to the west called <b>Tiha Jama</b> ended rather close to the floor of
the doline <b>Globocak</b>.
So a tunnel was dug to create a second entrance to the cave.
During the years the tunnel was used both as exit and entrance to the cave.
The current direction, entering the cave here is definitely more dramatic.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
At the end of the tunnel a voluminous cavern is entered, not exceptional in
comparison to other Slowenian caves, but still impressive.
But going from chamber to chamber, each one is bigger than the last one.
Some are filled with huge formations, stalagmites, stalactites, curtains, and
rimstone pools.
Others are absolutely bare with enormous deposits of cave clay.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
As the caverns get bigger and bigger the stalactites are so far up, they become
almost invisible, and the shape of the stalagmites changes completely.
When the water falls down from great heights, at least 40m, the drop splashes on
the floor with high energy and atomizes in a certain diameter.
This results in a huge and wide stalagmite.
When the amount of water changes, the diameter changes also, and during time a

or <b>stack-of-plates-stalagmite</b> forms.
The last two chambers of this passage are big enough and form those rare
speleothems.
The tallest stalagmites are in the <b>Velika Dvorana</b> and are up to 25m high.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
<b>Tiha Jama</b> (Silent Cave) is a the fossil branch of the &#352;kocjanske
Jama.
It is an upper level, which is older and has no cave river anymore.
The river flows about 100m deeper in <b>Sumeca Jama</b> (Loud Cave), named such
because of the roar of the white waters.
Tiha Jama is about 500m long.
The end of silence is impressive: turning around a formation some noises are
heared.
Walking on, they grow louder and louder, and the air becomes more humid, even a
little misty.
The passage widens, but this time not only the ceiling goes up, also the floor
starts to go down, forming a steep slope into the enormous gorge.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
If you are at the end of the group, you can see people walking down in
serpentines, along the left wall and across a bridge onto the other side of the
gorge.
This gorge is one of the largest underground canyons in the world, reaches
heights of up to 148m and in places widths of 100m.
The bridge is 70m high above the river.
Through the mist, with powerful electric lamps all over the huge cavern, which
are still not able to light it completely, this situation resembles the descent
to hell.
This view is obviously one of the most spactacular views inside a cave, all over
the world!

<p class="indentedText">
Further down you can look to the right, up the gorge towards the entrance near
the village &#352;kocjan.
Depending on the time of year, there may be a deafening, roaring wild water at
the bottom, or a small and probably a littly stinky brook.
During floods, after snow melt, the gorge may fill several tens of meters.
In some years the bridge is flooded and the water rises towards Tiha Jama, the
levels of the most extraordinary years are marked by plates along the path.
The reason for this flooding is the narrowing passage at the end of the cave.
If more water than this swallow hole swallows comes down the gorge, the water
level rises.
The highest water levels require a flood of the polje upstream.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
At the bottom of the slope we are still more than 70m above the river, and the
path is built into the wall to the left, going downstream for a short distance
to the bridge.
Standing on this bridge, we can have a look downstream, into a cave passage
which is explored for more than a kilometre, opening various times forming
enormous chambers.
The end is a syphon, which is extremely dangerous and still unexplored.
Because of dye tracing experiments we know, that much of the water reappears in
the spring of the Timavo river in Italy.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
After the bridge, on the other side of the gorge, the path goes along the
vertical wall, on a sort of artificial ledge.
Although the direction is upstream, the path descends continually, until it
almost reaches the river.
There are other paths, older ones, built by various explorations of the cave.
Some of them may be visited on special tours, others are only for speleologists.

<p class="indentedText">
After so much gorge, the path turns left and uphill into a side passage.
Huge halls, upper levels of the gorge, formed by the river long ago when it was
flowing in this height.
Beneath various huge stalactites and stalagmites, there is a true gem.
The
<button data-role="button" data-inline="true" data-mini="true"><a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../explain/Speleothem/RimstonePool.html"><img vspace="0" hspace="0" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Explain.gif" width="12" height="12"><b>rimstone pools</b></a></button>
of &#352;kocjan Cave are probably the most famous ones.
Extremely thins walls of calcite, only a few centimeters thick, but up to one
metre high, form perfect bows.
Dry during summer, they often fill again during wet season.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
There are famous pictures of the rimstone pool, at least 30 years old, which
show cave guides standing inside the pools.
This gives a good impression of the size, but it is a disaster for the
conservancy of the speleothems, so it is absolutely forbidden now to enter them.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
We are now high above the gorge again, in a side passage branching off to the
left, and soon the path descends again into a huge cavern.
This is another dry part of the cave which is open to the huge collapse doline
below the village &#352;kocjan.
It is called <b>Schmidl-Grotte</b>, after an early cave explorer.
This is an impressive spot, at the border between sunlight and darkness, with
impressive dimensions and the shape of a huge church, a medieval dome.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Today the path goes along the right wall of the doline, slightly ascending to
the lower station of the funicular, the cable car, which brings the visitors
uphill.
On this way we cross the portal where the Reka flows into &#352;kocjan Cave,
although we are not able to see very well it from above.
On the ride up the church of &#352;kocjan appears on top of the opposite wall,
with the Reka entering the doline right below.
But the path to the cable car and from the upper station to the ticket office
still includes some labour.
There is no hurry, and the cable car goes up and down all the time, so take your
time and avoid overstraining.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Some decades ago, before the funicular was built, the visitors followed a path
on the left side.
The path is built along an almost vertical limestone wall, until it reaches the
huge <b>Tominz Grotte</b>.
This cave has a small fountain inside, named Kraus Brunnen, which was errected
in 1889.
Then the path reaches the Reka, where it crosses the last remain of the original
cave between the two huge dolines.
It forms a sort of natural bridge, right in the middle of the huge doline.
It is possible towalk into the arch of the natural bridge to an outlook, where
you can see both ends at the same time.
Then the path continues on the north side of the river up to the top of the
natural bridge and you cross the Reka to the south side this way.
This ascend was very strenuous, especially as no wind cools the hiker in the pit
of the doline.
We guess this is the reason why the funicular was built.
</p>

<br>

<p>
The &#352;kocjan Caves are definitely a full day experience.
You should also visit the other attractions.
First of all there is a <b>karst trail</b>, which starts at the ticket office.
It leads through Matavun, &#352;kocjan, and then back around the doline.
There are numerous interesting things on the surface, like dolines, water
collectors, cave collapses and of course the lookouts into the huge doline.
There are also two rather new museums in &#352;kocjan, one about the daily life
in this barren landscape, another one about the caves and their explorations.
The church at &#352;kocjan is very nice, and there is an impressive view across
the flysh plain to the Sneznik from the church yard.
