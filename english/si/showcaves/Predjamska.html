        <p>
            <b>Predjamska Jama</b> is a huge cave system with four levels.
            The deepest level is water filled, the river flowing through is called <b>Lovka</b>.
            The Lokva sinks into the cave at the foot of the cliff face, right below the cave castle, and the river flows into the Mediterranean sea.
            As the Pivka, which flows through Postojna Cave, drains towards the Black Sea, the European Watershed is actually halfway between Postojna and Predjama.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The castle <b>Predjamski Grad</b> was built into the huge entrance of the third level, which is located between the other passages, but nevertheless is not connected to the rest of the cave system.
            In other words, despite being just different stages of the developing cave, they are listed as different caves, the castle is in <b>Erazmova Jama</b>, the other three levels are <b>Predjamska Jama</b>.
            An exit shaft from the castle to the plateau was used as secret entrance during the Middle Ages.
            Erasmus ordered to enlarge the shaft and equipped it with wooden ladders, and was used to supply the castle with food in the times of siege, but also to secretly commit robberies.
            This part of the cave may be visited with a cave trekking tour.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            From the road to the castle it's possible to see three entrances, the river sink at the bottom, the second level between the river and the castle, and the castle with the cave.
            The fourth level higher up is hidden by vegetation and not visible.
            The engraving by <b class="smallCaps">Valvasor</b> shows the wall of the stable which is marked "Die grotte".
            The heading says <i>"LUEG an der Porkh Jama"</i>, obviously the cave with the castle inside was named <b>Porkh Jama</b> at that time.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave tour enters the cave on the second level, and is thus also called <b>Jama pod Predjamskim gradom</b> (Cave under Predjam Castle)
            Today there is a trail branching off from the road to the cave castle on the left side leading down the grassy slope to the cave entrance below the castle.
            As this entrance is located in the cliff face, there is a gap over which a bridge was built.
            The second level is much smaller than the castle cave, but still it is big enough to use it as stables.
            The entrance is closed by a massive wall, and there is another wall at the far end, probably to avoid horses vanishing into the cave, or to keep the warmth in the stable.
            This artificially enhanced part is called <b>Konjski hlev</b> (Horse Stable) and has electrical light.
            The cave tour enters though the stable door.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave behind is developed as a show cave with trails, and a long staircase in a huge chamber which connects the second and the fourth level.
            But the cave has no light, visitors get very bright handheld lamps from the guide.
            Good walking shoes are also strongly recommended as the trails are partly dug into the cave clay and might be a little slippery.
            It's also possible to do the tour with gum boot.
            The tour is definitely not a cave trekking tour, so caving gear is not required.
            There are a few points where the ceiling is low, and it is necessary to stoop.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The beginning of the lower passage is called <b>Glavni rov</b> (Main Passage) and is quite spacious.
            It's an almost circular passage where the water was flowing under high pressure.
            Then it gets smaller, and the trail was dug up to one meter into the cave clay, so it is possible to walk upright.
            At one point it is possible to enter a side branch which is lower, and after some stooping the <b>Imenski rov</b> (Names Passage) is reached.
            This is the place where visitors in former centuries left their names and the date of the visit.
            The oldest signatures date back to the 16th century.
            This part of the cave has almost no speleothems, the water flowing through the tubes prevented the deposition of limestone.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Veliko dvorano</b> (Great Chamber) is the return point of the tour.
            It seems the cave ceiling collapsed and so the three levels were connected, forming one single chamber with the floors gone.
            There is some distance between the levels, so there is a rather long iron staircase built through the middle of the chamber.
            Walking up the vibrating staircase in the total darkness with only the light of the handheld lamps is one of the highlights of the tour.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The upper passage is completely different and called <b>Fiženca</b>.
            It winds canyon-like through the rock and with a continuous ascent in the opposite direction of the lower section.
            The highest point of the tour is right at the exit, high above the castle.
            From here a trail leads down to the level of the castle.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There are also cave trekking tours of the Erazmov and Vzhodni rov, and a guided walk to the <b>Vetrovne luknje</b> (Wind Hole) is also available.
            They are called <b>Adrenalinski ogledi</b> (Adrenaline tours) and include challenging sections and even river passages.
            They are offered in three difficulty classes.
            Suitable caving equipment is provided.
        </p>
