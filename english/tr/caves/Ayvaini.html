        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Ayvaini Mağarası</b> (Ayva ini magarasi, Cave of Ayva) is named after nearby village Ayva.
            It is a through-cave which is generally entered through its upper entrance called <b>Doğanalanı</b> (40.105185947998564, 28.68281906929129).
            Here the cave starts with a 17 m drop which must be abseiled, the rest of the cave is almost horizontal.
            If the drop is too steep, you may try the other entrance called <b>Ayvaköy</b> and enter the cave upstream.
            This lower entrance is the resurgence of the cave river and flooded after rains during winter.
            Most pages write that the cave was "hydrologically active", and we guess they did not understand the term.
            It simply means that this is a so-called river cave where a cave river flows seasonally.
            This page is intended to warn before you go, the information which is published on the web is more or less nonsense.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This cave is 4,866 m long [2020], which made it at that time the eighth-longest cave of Turkey.
            However, such superlatives change frequently, every time a new cave is discovered and surveyed or an old one extended.
            The distance between the two entrances is 2.6 km as the crow flies, pages giving 4 km or more probably talk about the road.
            There are about half a dozen POIs on Google Maps, and all of them are wrong, as well as the one on OSM and the coordinates on Wikipedia.
            On the other hand, it is actually not difficult to find the cave entrance: follow the Karadonlu river bed upstream.
            This works best when there is no river, so best time for a visit is definitely when there was no rain for some time in late summer.
            There is no development at all, even the access to the cave entrances is tricky and overgrown.
            If you see a show cave photo on one of the Google pages, it's from another cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Several pages state for years that development work is ongoing.
            The government placed a road sign for the upper entrance, and there are sings in the village, probably placed by the municipality.
            The cave is a 2-hour drive from Istanbul, that's weekend or day trip distance, a great potential for domestic tourism.
            We are actually astonished that it was not developed as a show cave long ago.
            There actually was a plan to develop the lower entrance with an elevated trail around 2010.
            But in 2012 the Mağara Araştırmacıları Derneği Bursa Şubesi (Bursa Branch of Cave Researchers Association) objected to these plans with the argument that the cave will lose its naturalness and turn into a picnic area.
            Its unclear if the politicians actually understood their concerns, or if there were other reasons, but all development plans were subsequently cancelled.
            A part of the web pages listing it as a tourist site were subsequently deleted, unfortunately there are still some online and people get the wrong expression that it was an easy tourist cave.
            Actually, there is not even a trail from the village to the cave entrance.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This cave is very popular, there are even signs on the road, but it is not developed.
            A tour is a real caving trip, it is not a show cave as stated on several pages, including the Wikipedia page.
            The dry entrance starts with a 17 m drop, climbing gear and skills are mandatory, it is definitely <b>not</b> a harmless semi-wild cave.
            Bring appropriate clothes and shoes, helmet and lamp.
            Rubber boots are also advisable, as this cave has a cave river.
            Never cave alone and leave a return time with a trustworthy person.
            Even better, if possible, find a cave trekking operator who offers the tour.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave offers numerous speleothems, including rimstone pools and calcite crystals.
            Be careful where you walk and do not destroy the formations.
        </p>
