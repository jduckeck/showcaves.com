        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Sudwala Caves</b> are not the most visited caves of South Africa,
            nevertheless they are the most extraordinary caves in the country.
            They are located in extremely old Precambrian dolomite, are one of the oldest
            caves on Earth and have the biggest chamber known in dolomite rocks.
            And we would like to add, this is the cave with the biggest amount of nonsense
            is told about on the internet and elsewhere.
            Even the Wikipedia page repeats the nonsense in modified form.
            Unfortunately we do not have any scientific publication on this cave, so we have
            to interpret the information we found.
            But we will do our best to eliminate at least the sheer nonsense.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The area of Mpumalanga where the caves are located is covered by granites and
            gneisses, crystalline rock formed during the Archaean (4-2.5Ga).
            And then there are some patches of dolomite, which are still old, but not older
            than about 2.5Ga years, because this is the begin of the Proterozoic, where the
            first multi-celled organisms lived.
            Limestone and dolomite are biogene rocks, the components are eroded from
            crystalline rocks and recombined by marine life which uses the calcite for their
            skeletons.
            As a result there is no dolomite older than life on earth, and there are
            definitely no dolomites 3.8Ga old.
            Although there are very few rocks on earth which are that old, South Africa
            is famous for having the oldest rocks which are found in great amounts.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The limestone contains fossils called <b>stromatolites</b>, which are round and
            layered cylinders formed by limestone depostited layer by layer on the top.
            Responible for the limestone are cyano bacteria, also called collenia or
            blue-green algae, some of the oldest life forms on earth.
            The stromatolitic limestones of the <b>Schmidtsdrif Formation</b> (Transvaal
            Dolomite) have been dated lately to be 2.5Ga old.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The caves are one of the oldest cave systems on earth, but definitely not the
            oldest.
            The caves were formed during the Permian, about 240Ma ago.
            Some formations in the cave have been dated to be 200Ma old.
            At the moment the oldest valid date for a cave is from Jenolan Caves in
            Australia, where a cave sediment has been dated to be about twice as old.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But we believe Sudwaka cave contains the largest dolomite chamber in the world.
            Unfortunately there is no official list of chambers in dolomite.
            <b class="smallCaps">P.R. Owen Hall</b>, named after the original owner of the
            cave, is about 70m in diameter and 37m in height.
            The largest chamber in limestone, Sarawak Chamber in Borneo, is 600m long and
            400m wide.
            But on the other hand dolomite is less soluble and dolomite caves are generally
            much smaller than limestone caves.
            We find it plausible that this superlative is true.
            However, the hall is definitely impressive independent of the statistic facts.
            Because of its extraordinary good accoustics it is used for occasional concerts.
            <b class="smallCaps">Ivan Rebroff</b>, the German tenor, tested the accoustics
            being "...at least equal if not superior to those of any concert hall or opera
            house in Europe".
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tourist route through the cave is about 600m long, but as it is a dead end,
            the visitor has to walk back the same path.
            The cave entrance is located on the hillside, with a nice view, and the cave is
            going into the hill horizontally.
            So it is strange to speak of deepness, but the passages are covered by up to
            120m of rocks.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There is also a monthly spelunking tour which takes five hours and ends at the
            crystal chamber containing aragonite crystals.
            This tour is called Crystal Tour.
            Participants have to crawl and there are some wet passages, but the difficulty
            is called moderate as no vertical parts exist.
            Bring appropriate clothes, good shoes, towel and dry clothes to change
            afterwards.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There is a legend how the cave was discovered in the early 19th century.
            It was discovered by <b class="smallCaps">Somquba</b>, son of Swazi King
            <b class="smallCaps">Sobhuza I</b>.
            The king had a dispute with his brother <b class="smallCaps">Mswati</b> which
            involved substantial numbers of royal cattle.
            In fear they built a village next to the cave entrance hid in the cave every
            time Mswati and his punitive parties arrived.
            Mswati tried in vain to smoke them out by making huge fires in the entrance.
            But one day he struck unexpectedly and killed Sobhuza.
            The remains of Sobhuza's tribe had a new headman or Induna named
            <b class="smallCaps">Sudwala</b>, hence the name of the cave.
        </p>
