        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Futenma Gongen</b> is a small Shinto shrine in the city of Ginwan, close to
            the US Marine Corps Air Station Futenma.
            There are two ornate gold-laced buildings that combine classic Japanese and
            Okinawan architecture.
            This place of tranquility and worship, guarded by an ancient torii, is used for
            worship by many Okinawans.
            And often Japanese women who married American soldiers from the nearby mititary
            base come to the shire with their husband before they are deployed to war zones.
            The worship purifies the men so that they will have power to ward off evils.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Close to the shrine is a small cave of great beauty.
            It contains many speleothems and the bones of deer and wild boars, about 20,000
            years old.
            How long the cave has been frequented by man is not known, but people were
            worshiping at the cave before recorded history and long before the shrine was
            built.
            According to legend, the cave was home to a young woman of matchless beauty who
            later became a goddess.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The temples were built about 500 years ago during the first Sho dynasty by King
            <b class="smallCaps">Sho Kinpuku</b>.
            Once a straight road existed, from the king's residence through the torii to the
            shrine.
            So the king could travel directly to the shrine for worship.
            Prior to World War II, there still was a beautiful avenue of pine trees.
            This road does not exist any more, it was where now Marine Corps Air Station
            Futenma lies.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The presence of the US army is a result of lost World War II.
            During the <b>Battle of Okinawa</b>, which lasted from late March through June
            1945, the cave was used as an air raid shelter.
            This battle is called <b>Typhoon of Steel</b> in English, or <b>tetsu no ame</b>
            in Japanese, which gives an impression of the ferocity of the fighting.
            At least 150,000 civilians were killed during the battle.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is open to the public every year on 30-JUN, when people walk the 50m
            long trail through the cave.
            Walking the 50m long through cave is a symbol for going back to ones mother's
            womb and being reborn, the walkers are purified.
            This through trip is made by about 800 people every year.
            Although this through trip is closed the rest of the year, shrine visitors may
            ask to visit the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is entered through a vaulted door located behind the shrines.
            Moss covered limestone stairs lead down to the cave entrance where the oldest altars of the shrine are located.
            Visitors are asked to pay their respects to the spirits before entering the caves.
            There are two stalagmites, which are said to symbolize fertility with their phallic forms.
            Many couples who with to have children come here to pray for fertility.
            The path once passes over a small rivulet on a footbridge, according to legend a wish made while crossing the bridge will come true.
            The cave has three chambers, the largest is the last one, which is 15m wide and 6m high and called the <b>inner shrine</b>.

            At the end of the cave is metal-grated door which is opened only once every year on 30-JUN at 18:00 to celebrate the end of the rainy season.
            This is the reason why visitors have to return through the cave the rest of the year,
        </p>
