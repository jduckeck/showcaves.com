        <h2>Geology</h2>

        <p>
            The coal was deposited about 130 to 150 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous.
        </p>


        <br class="clear">


        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The heyday of <b>Wonthaggi State Coal Mine</b> was in the first half of the 20th
            century, when coal was needed to power Victoria's railway network.
            Before the mine was opened, Victoria was completely reliant on the private
            collieries in New South Wales for its supply.
            The prices were high and disruptions to the supply were a constant problem.
            In 1909 a strike in New South Wales completely stopped coal supply for Vitoria,
            and the Victorian Government was forced to open an emergency coal mine at the
            Wonthaggi coal fields.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            State Coal Mine soon became one of the largest and most dangerous collieries in
            Australia.
            Working conditions were considerably worse than those of the private mines.
            The State Mine was handed over to the Railways Department, who had little mining
            experience.
            In the years before World War I miners from all over the world arrived at
            Wonthaggi.
            Many came from Great Britain, where decades of bitter conflicts had forged
            strong union ideals.
            Wonthaggi became the centre of a highly organised militant unionism.
            A strike of fife months in 1934 ends with a victory of the miners.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The mine was still unsafe, and the protest of the union was ignored.
            On 15-FEB-1937 20 shafts blew up and 13 men lost their lives.
            This tragedy resulted in a successful national campaign to improve conditions
            for all Australian miners.
            However, only twelve years later, in 1949, again record numbers of killed and
            injured miners were counted.
            A nation wide strike was ended by the Federal Chifley Labor Government, by
            sending troops and jailing the union leaders.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The mine was finally closed in 1968, and during 59 years of operation it
            produced 17 million tons of coal.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The visit inludes historic buildings housing machinery and photographic
            displays, an audio-visual interpretation of Wonthaggi's history, and a mining
            museum in the newly built Visitor Centre.
            A short film traces the history of the mines.
            A steam locomotive K192 is on display, which burnt Wonthaggi coal as its fuel.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The underground tour starts with a 280 m walk into the East Area mine.
            The guides tell stories of working conditions underground, the humour and the
            hardship of being a miner.
            Underground tours are guided by Parks Victoria staff and volunteers, many of
            them have personal connections to the mine.
            Some guides are retired miners.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The mine and the underground tour had to be closed in 2004, because it failed to
            comply with occupational health and safety laws.
            Thanks to 3 Million AUD state and federal government grants in 2011 the mine has
            undergone an extensive refurbishment.
            In April 2012 a new Visitor Centre and underground tour were opened to the
            public.
