        <h2>Geology</h2>

        <p>
            The gold was first found in <b>alluvial</b> deposits along both branches of Back
            Creek.
            But the bed of the creek was narrow, and the gold content low, the deposits were
            soon worked out.
            The gold was often attached to water-worn fragments of quartz.
            The miners looked for the quartz veins and discovered auriferous reef in the
            surrounding hills.
            Gold bearing reefs were found between the Barrington River through Copeland to
            the Bowman River in an some 8km long strip.

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The historic <b>Mountain Maid Mine</b> is managed by the National Parks and
            Wildlife Service (NPWS) as part of Copeland Tops State Conservation Area.
            It is one mine of the <b>Copeland Goldfield</b>, which was discovered in 1876
            and produced about 11 tons of gold, which equals about AUD 400 Million.
            The very fist gold at Copeland was discovered by the cedar getter Mr
            <b class="smallCaps">Saxby</b> in July 1876, at Back Creek close to the later
            site of the township of Copeland.
            The population increased rapidly to 1,100, of which 800 were miners.
            During the last 25 years of the 19th century there were about 70 mines around
            the mining town Copeland.
            Then the number slowly decreased until 1930 when most of the mines were closed.
            The town Copeland vanished, and today only few remains of the town exist.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Mountain Maid Mine</b> is the last remaining mine of Copeland.
            It is located in lush rain forest in the valley of the Copeland Creek.
            There is an exhibition of mining memorabilia and tools.
            From the machinery the stamper battery with the steam engines, which powered the
            stamper once, both still exist, but are defunct.
            Other machinery are the ore crusher, conveying equipment, railway with wagons,
            and a turntable.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tour also includes an underground part, where the gold mine is entered and
            the gold bearing quartz vein can be seen.
            A wooden walkway extends hundreds of meters into the mountain.
            The mine extends some 395m into the hillside and to a depth of 180m.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Mountain Maid Reef</b> was discovered in October 1876 by
            <b class="smallCaps">Doust</b>, <b class="smallCaps">Gill</b> and
            <b class="smallCaps">Irwin</b>.
            They opened <b>Mountain Maid Mine</b> the same year and yielded 417kg of gold
            during the first ten years.
            This mine was once the richest of the Copeland mines.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Some years ago Mountain Maid Gold Mine was the central part of the award
            winning, heritage listed Gold Town theme park.
            The mine was called a working mine, probably because some gold bearing quartz
            was removed for the on-site gold washing for the visitors.
            Then the mine was closed and since 2003 it is managed by the National Parks and
            Wildlife Service (NPWS).
            They closed the site for renovation for several years, but it was reopened in
            2010 by <b class="smallCaps">Jodi McKay</b>, the Minister for Tourism.
            The NSW Government has invested NZD 820,000 into the upgrade of the facilities.
            The site now has three official trails.
            The <b>Hidden Treasures walk</b> (4.5km) and the <b>Basin Loop Trail</b> (7km)
            are both self guided.
            The trails have new walkways and viewing platforms, and new explanatory signs.
            The <b>Mountain Maid Link Trail</b> is a guided tour only, which includes the
            underground tour.
            The light system of the underground tour was upgraded.
