        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Timor Caves</b> are a number of caves in the Upper Hunter Valley, which are more on the real caving side than what we normally list.
            Most caves in this section are so-called semi-wild caves, caves which are not developed in any way but are extremely easy to visit, generally horizontal caves, high enough to walk upright.
            If they are not that easy to visit we list them only if there are organized cave trekking trips.
            These caves here require caving, and as far as we know there are no organized cave trekking trips, nevertheless they are extremely popular and listed on numerous websites and in guidebooks.
            So we thought it would be a good thing to provide some background info and some warnings.
            Let’s start with the warnings: these are wild caves and require full caving equipment, in other words good shoes or gum boots, caving overall, helmet with headlamp, two reserve lamps, knee pads and gloves.
            Bring clothes to change, a towel, and plastic bags for dirty equipment.
            Never cave alone, a group of three or four is ideal, tell someone where you are going, and when you will be back, so the rescue is alarmed when you get lost.
            These are the caving 101 rules for wild caves, they are mandatory, not optional, please follow them.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The original inhabitants of the Timor area were members of the Geawegal Tribe, who lived along the northern tributaries of the Hunter River.
            The Wonnarua lived downstream in the mid-Hunter Valley.
            If they knew or visited the caves is unknown, there is no archaeological evidence so far.
            The early visits of the caves by European settlers were not documented, the name <b>Timor</b> is first mentioned in 1848 in the Wells Gazette, but it was in use for some time before.
            The occurrence of limestone was first reported by Reverend <b class="smallCaps">William Clarke</b>, a surveyor with the NSW Government, in 1852.
            He did not mention any caves, though.
            But there are signatures from cave visitors on the walls of the caves with older dates, so the caves were already known at that time.
            News about the caves spread first in 1875 with an article describing caves in <i>The Murrurundi Times</i>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Murrurundi Shire Council considered using Timor Caves for tourism in the 1970s, but there was no plan for how to do this.
            This and later attempts to develop the caves failed, and there is still no development of any cave.
            Nevertheless, the caves were quite popular among locals, cavers and backpackers, and so there are numerous visitors and even some basic campgrounds.
            Do not expect electricity or toilets, but it’s allowed to stay overnight if you take your rubbish with you.
            The basic bush camping site at Isaacs Creek is located on private property, and the property owner charges a fee for camping.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The limestone at Timor is 30 Ma old, formed in a shallow marine environment, and is full of fossils.
            A period of intensive volcanic activity buried the limestone with volcanic rocks, which pressed and also heated the sediments, the limestone formation was faster and more intense than normally.
            Later tectonic movements faulted the rocks, creating steeply dipping beds.
            The cracks and bedding planes allowed water to enter and karstification started.
            The area has numerous caves like Glen Dhu, Shaft Cave, Main Cave, Belfrey Cave, Rip off Cave, Waterfall Cave and Lake Cave.
            The majority of the larger caves are within the <b>Timor Caves Reserve</b>, which is part of the Upper Hunter Local Government Area.
            The four major caves Main Cave, Belfry Cave, Helictite Cave and Hill Cave can be accessed on Isaacs Creek–Sargents Gap Road.
            The road is unsealed in sections, and the caves are undeveloped, so an appropriate 4WD vehicle and caving gear are mandatory.
            <b>Main Cave</b> is an important roosting site for <b>eastern bent-wing bats</b> (<i>Miniopterus schreibersii oceanensis</i>) during winter.
            The area also has karren fields and limestone pavements, which are rather good to see due to sparse vegetation, mostly grass trees (<i>Xanthorrhoea glauca</i> subsp. <i>angustifolia</i>).
            There are several karst springs with tufa deposits.
