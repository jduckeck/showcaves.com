        <h2>Description</h2>


        <p>
            <b>Hermit's Cave</b> is a sort of rock shelter which was altered to become a
            cave house.
            It was constructed by the Italian immigrant <b class="smallCaps">Valerio
            Recitti</b>.
            The cave is a sort of labyrinth including stone structures, gardens, stairs, a
            kitchen, and a chapel.
            It even has a water well and a lookout.
            There are floral painted rock walls and inscriptions.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b class="smallCaps">Valerio Recitti</b> was born ins Italy in 1899 and
            travelled to Australia in 1916.
            He first worked at Broken Hill but then began drifting.
            After a yer of timber-cutting, with all his wages in his pocket, he visited a
            brothel in Adelaide.
            What followed is really weird: he forgot his wallet in the brothel, but the
            bouncer did not let him in.
            Finally he threw a rock through a window, as he wanted back his wages.
            It is not really clear if this was a scam by the brothel or because he could not
            speak English.
            However, after the thrown rock he was chased and sentenced to two years in
            Adelaide jail.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The next story is equally weird.
            After being released from jail he moved to Melbourne.
            He owned only one thing, a coat, which he intended to pawn.
            A passer-by said he would pawn it for him, but never returned.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But he was lucky and found a job on a Murray River paddle steamers.
            When he came through Griffith in the 1920s he found the cave and decided to
            stay.
            <b class="smallCaps">Recitti</b> thought he was the only Italian in the area and
            so he did not contact any of his neighbours and became the <b>hermit</b>
            namesake to the cave.
            He decided to construct a private paradise by clearing and decorating the caves.
            Caves, galleries, and cliff side gardens were connected by pathways, which
            required the moving of hundreds of tons of rock.
            As he wanted to stay alone, he worked at night and early in the morning.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            One day <b class="smallCaps">Recitti</b> fell and injured himself.
            He was found by a passing swagman and taken to the hospital.
            The enormity of his work was discovered and much marvelled at, so he became a
            celebrity.
            He was reunited with his old friends, old compatriots from Broken Hill who had
            settled nearby.
            Increasing numbers of Italian migrants had arrived and formed a small Italian
            comunity.
            He now got a job, but he continued to live in his cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            During World War II many immigrants were interned.
            This included <b class="smallCaps">Recitti</b> and other Italians, who were
            interned at Hay.
            They had to work building roads, and he instructed his captors on how to improve
            their road-building methods.
            After his release he was re-employed by his old friends in Griffith.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In 1952, <b class="smallCaps">Recitti</b> was 53 years old, and he was troubled
            by visions and obsessions.
            He also became sick, and so he decided to travel to Italy to see his old
            homeland once again.
            He died there six months later.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Half a century his cave was open and nobody cared about it.
            Now the hillside gardens are restored to their former glory by a local service
            club.
            A copy of <b class="smallCaps">Recitti</b>s biography is available from the
            visitors centre.
            The escarpment where the cave is located, a spur of the McPherson range, is
            called Scenic Hill, and there are numerous scenic trails.
        </p>
