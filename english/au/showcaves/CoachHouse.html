        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The <b>Devil's Coach House</b> is something between a cave ruin, a through-cave and a natural bridge.
            A lot of the cave has collapsed and is now more or less a roofless cave or valley.
            The entrance from Blue Lake is a huge portal with a small cave river, and it has numerous karstfensters in the ceiling.
            This part of the gigantic structure does not need any artificial light it is sufficiently illuminated by daylight.
            The coachouse part of the name is easy to explain, just by the size of this entrance, the rest is normally said to be the result of a vision of an early visitor.
            He hallucinated the devil himself driving through the arch in a horse-drawn coach.
            However, in a local newspaper from the late 19th century is the following explanation.
            It's actually a letter to the editor by a reader.
        </p>

        <p class="foreign">
            <b class="smallCaps">James Whalan</b> is the real discoverer of Jenolan Caves.
            It was after he captured the bushranger <b class="smallCaps">McEwen</b>, who robbed his team of the bullock bows and chains at a place known as Coogie Flat, near Gingkin.
            Mr. <b class="smallCaps">James Whalan</b>, with the assistance of a police officer and <b class="smallCaps">Jerh Beale</b>, tracked <b class="smallCaps">McEwen</b> to the top of the range above his camp, when they saw the smoke of his fire.
            They camped for the night; the descent was made in the morning, when they captured <b class="smallCaps">McEwen</b>, whom they secured and handed over to the authorities.
            <b class="smallCaps">James Whalan</b> returned to his camp to try and find some of his property, which included bullock bows and chains, horses, and a steel mill which were used at that time to grind wheat for the Government men told off to <b class="smallCaps">James Whalan</b> to serve their time.
            When he got to the hut where they had taken him he followed the valley down to within about ¾ of a mile of the caves.
            He left his horse and walked down, it being impossible to get his horse with him.
            He then went through the archways; finding he could not get down the river further he went about the daylight caves and returned to his horse, and could not get any of his property.
            When it was reported <b class="smallCaps">McEwen</b> was taken, a stockman at Lowther got a blackfellow to take him to <b class="smallCaps">McEwen</b>'s camp, and he took the steel mill away between the time <b class="smallCaps">Whalan</b> had taken <b class="smallCaps">McEwen</b> and when he returned to look for his stolen property.
            <b class="smallCaps">Whalan</b> heard of the mill being taken and went and identified it by a No. 8 on one of the bolts.
            When <b class="smallCaps">McEwen</b> robbed <b class="smallCaps">Whalan</b> he always packed what he took on <b class="smallCaps">Whalan</b>'s horses.
            When he got near his camp he killed the horses so that they would not track the horses back and find him.
            I was told this by <b class="smallCaps">Whalan</b>'s stockman, <b class="smallCaps">James Campbell</b>, after-wards in 1855; so that <b class="smallCaps">James Whalan</b> was the real discoverer of Jenolan Caves, in 1841, and the first man to enter them.
            When he returned he told people that he had been at the end of the world in the <b>Devil's Coach-house</b>, so that is how it got its name.
            <b class="smallCaps">Jerh Beale</b>, who tracked <b class="smallCaps">McEwen</b>, told me all they had done from starting to track.
            They did not see the caves until after the capture of <b class="smallCaps">McEwen</b>.
            Mr. <b class="smallCaps">J. Whalan</b> searched several times for his bullock harness and his horses.
            When I heard that <b class="smallCaps">McEwen</b> took the bullock bows and chains I did not believe he carried them so far, but when exploring about fourteen years ago I found the bullock bows, six bows, two pairs of iron hinges, and two harrow pins, planted in a cave.
            There are scores of people who have seen them in the cave since I discovered it.
            This is the true account of the discovery of Jenolan Caves, and as I have been exploring them since 1855, I have collected the particulars from eye witnesses as to <b class="smallCaps">James Whalan</b>'s work and the robbery at his house by <b class="smallCaps">McEwen</b>.
            I have taken a great delight in the exploring of the caves and everything in connection with their discovery, etc., before my time here.
        </p>

        <p class="">
            Actually the name is just a name, and who actually hallucinated the coach is not really important.
            Quite important is the question of how to get there.
            This is not a show cave, it is actually freely accessible.
            There is an almost horizontal short trail from the road, opposite the Blue Lake on the eastern side of the Grand Arch, which leads directly to the arch.
            Unfortunately, it is now closed for some years due to rockfall.
            It is unclear if and when it will be reopened.
            For the time being the <b>Devil's Coach House</b> is reached from the <b>Carlotta Arch</b> trail.
            Its also posible to get there through
            <a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../au/showcaves/Nettle.html"><img alt="Showcave" class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Showcave.png">Nettle Cave</a>
            which seems to be freely accessible as well.
            However, the official website, though quite informative on many aspects of the caves, does not mention this rather important detail, so we guess you haveto ask when you arrive.
        </p>
