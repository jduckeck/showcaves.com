        <p>
            The <b>Abercrombie Caves</b> were probably discovered around 1820, in 1821 an article in the Sydney Gazette mentioned the discovery of a huge cave in the area.
            They reported that <i>'a cave of considerable dimensions has been recently discovered in the neighbourhood of Bathurst'</i>.
            However, there is no possibility to identify the cave from the article and so it is only an educated guess that this was Abercrombie.
            The cave was the hideout of some bushrangers (outlaws) known as <b>The Ribbon Gang</b>, led by the disgruntled convict <b class="smallCaps">Ralph Entwistle</b>.
            The gang started to afflict the area in September 1830, but in October 1830 they were tracked down and after a bloody battle the bushrangers entered the Arch of Abercrombie Cave, which was called <b>The Bridge</b> at that time.
            They escaped through an exit hole, but were caught the next day.
            Two members of the gang died from wounds, the remaining ten were hanged on 02-NOV-1830.
            It seems long trials were not very popular at that time.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This is the first account of the caves, and probably because of the bloody history the caves became popular during the next years.
            At first primarly people from the surrounding properties visited the caves, then gold was discovered and gold diggers visited the cave and built the stage in the Archway for Saturday evening dances.
            And then the number of visitors from Sydney increased, and the caves became real show caves with the employment of a temporary keeper.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In <b>Abercrombie Reserve</b> more than 50 caves are known today.
            The highlight is the <b>Abercrombie Archway</b> or <b>Archway Cave</b>, a
            <a target="_top" href="../../explain/Geology/NaturalBridge.html"><img alt="Geology" class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Geology.png">Natural Bridge</a>
            221&nbsp;m long, 70&nbsp;m wide and 30&nbsp;m high.
            It is the largest natural arch in the southern hemisphere, representing the ruins, the last remains of a collapsed cave system.
            Many other parts of this cave system still exist, accessible primarily from the arch.
            The various guided tours concentrate on different parts of the main passage.
        </p>


        <ul class="biglist">
            <li>The <b>Archway Cave</b> is visited on a 1.4&nbsp;km long self guided tour, which brings the visitor to the southern end of the Archway along Grove Creek, then through Grove Creek valley to the northern end where it enters the cave.
                Part of the tour is the <b>Golddigger’s Stage</b>, a large platform, used for dances and concert performances.
                It was built by gold miners, living in the area since the year 1854.
                A nice tour to explore the main sight at your own pace.
                Recommended for photographers.
            </li>
            <li><b>Bushrangers Cave</b> was named after the <b>Ribbon Boys</b>, who hid in this part of the cave in 1830, before they were captured.
                On this tour the guide concentrates on the history of the cave: bushranging, the discovery and exploration of the cave, the graffiti by early cave visitors.
                This tour shows three huge chambers with numerous beautiful formations.
                <b>The Pulpit</b> chamber is home for a small colony of Common Bentwing Bats.
            </li>
            <li><b>Grove Cave</b> is located at the southern end of the Grand Arch and is rather small.
                It is a fine example of a small and narrow solution passageway.
                The <b>Red Shawl Chamber</b> of this cave contains exceptionally beautiful shawls.
                Visitors that want to see a cave from a cavers perspective, can visit the <b>Grovel</b>, a crawly bit.
                This tour is not suitable for people who have problems with confined spaces.
            </li>
            <li><b>Belfrey Cave</b> is a somewhat special tour, as it shows certain older parts of the cave.
                The tours are limited to 12 persons and the minimum age is 5.
                Steep ladders and many steps are part of the tour.
                But the reward are views from the highest point in the roof of the Archway and interesting geological features like fossil deposits.
            </li>
            <li><b>Archway guided</b> is also called <b>King Solomon’s Temple</b>.
                This tour shows three huge chambers with numerous beautiful formations.
                This is the oldest part of the show cave, first visited in 1834.
                The Goldminers dance platform from 1880 and a walk over the suspension bridge are part of the tour.
                Behind the bridge are the galleries called King Solomon’s Temple, which have an abundance of speleothems.
            </li>
            <li>A <b>Night Tour</b> makes no sense in other caves.
                But Abercrombie, with its two huge entrances has daylight in many parts of the guided tour.
                At night the art of the light designers, undisturbed by natural light, allows different views of the gothic arches and the massive decorations of the cave.
                This tour is offered afzer appointment only and is rather long and strenuous.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            It seems the last two tours are currently not offered.
            As the park is closed due to necessary repairs after a flood in 2022, there might be updates after the reopening in APR-2023.
        </p>
