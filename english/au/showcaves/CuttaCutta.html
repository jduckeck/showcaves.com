      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
         <b>Cutta Cutta Caves</b> are actually the only show cave in the Northern Territory.
         Quite funny are thus pages which state that it is <i>"one of the most popular tourist caves in the Northern Territory"</i>.
         It is definitely the most popular, and at the same time it is the least popular, as it is the only one.
      </p>

      <p class="indentedText">
         The park is conveniently located at the famous Highway 1 or Stuart Highway, only 25&nbsp;km southeast of Katherine.
         It is a small park, the only highlight are the show caves, but it also offers bushwalking and birdwatching.
         There are around 170 species of birds, including the Hooded Parrot and the endangered Gouldian Finch.
         Beneath the walk to the cave there is a Woodland Walk and a Karst Walk.
         But the cave tours are only available by online booking, so please book your tour in advance and be at the Visitor Center at least 10 minutes earlier.
         Unlike most other parks in the Northern Territory there is no day fee for the park, but there is a rather steep fee for the tours.
      </p>

      <p class="indentedText">
         The tour starts at the Visitor Center with a 400 m hike to the cave.
         Both the hike on the surface and the underground tour are warm or even hot, so the most important equipment for the cave tour are hat, sunscreen, sunglasses, drinking water and fully enclosed shoes.
         The caves are 33 °C inside with almost 100 % humidity, so its essential to dress appropriately.
         There is a raised metal mesh pathway with railings, which is about 240 m long.
         It was obviously installed because of the floods, so it was possible to have tours even with water on the floor.
         This is not required any more, as the cave is completely closed during wet season.
         But it seems this was one of the origins of modern cave conservation concepts for show caves, which generally include raised pathways.
         There are some narrow sections as well as low sections which require stooping.
         At the end of the 700 m long passage is a sump, and there are also thermal springs in the cave, which increase the temperature further.
         This is obviously a natural thermal spa, unfortunately it is not accessible for visitors.
      </p>

      <p class="indentedText">
         The plural in Cutta Cutta Caves is actually a case of
         <a target="_top" href="../../../english/explain/Humor/PluralisAbsurditatis.html"><img alt="Smile" class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Smile.png">Pluralis Absurditatis</a>,
         although there are two show caves.
         The second cave, <b>Tindal Cave</b>, was opened to the public in 1991.
         But while it is equipped with electric light and trails it is closed for decades now.
         The reasons for this decision seem rather embarrassing as they were never made public.
         Actually the various descriptions of the cave including the official management plan lack numerous quite basic infos.
         We don't know the temperature of the cave, which is obviously quite high and humid.
         We don't know when and why the second show cave was closed.
         We do not even know when Cutta Cutta Cave was developed with trails and electric light, all accounts tell that tours started in 1967, but it seems the actual development took place later.
         Also, its unclear if the tours were guided by rangers or by a private operator.
         Again, we can only guess they are ashamed to tell such basic facts.
      </p>

      <p class="indentedText">
         The main cave was discovered around 1900 by a stockman and named <b>Smith’s Cave</b> after him.
         During World War II, servicemen called the cave <b>16 Mile Cave</b>, we can only guess because the cave is 16 miles from Katherine.
         In 1967 the <b>Sixteen Mile Caves Reserve</b> was formed and managed by the <b>Northern Territory Reserves Board</b>, which is today the <b>Parks and Wildlife Service of the Northern Territory</b>.
         At the same time the first guided tours started, either by rangers or by concession operators.
         The name <b>Cutta Cutta</b> is the original name by the local Jawoyn Indigenous people, who knew the cave for thousands of years and used to hunt in the caves.
         Cutta Cutta is a Jawoyn word meaning "many stars", after the legend which says that the starts rest in the underground during the day.
         It’s easy to understand that aborigines entering the cave with lighting, the calcite crystals in the speleothems reflected the light and shone like stars.
      </p>

      <p class="indentedText">
         The cave is home to wildlife including six species of bats, Little Cave Eptesicus, Dusky Leafnosed Bat, Common Sheathtail Bat, Common Bent-Wing Bat, Ghost Bat (<i>Macroderma gigas</i>), and Orange Horseshoe Bat (<i>Rhinonicteris aurantius</i>) as well as interesting invertebrate fauna.
         The caves were also home to numerous snakes such as the harmless brown tree snake (<i>Boiga irregularisis</i>).
         In the Visitor Center, a snake and a bat have been preserved in alcohol and can be viewed up close in a glass.
         During the last years the poisonous Aga toad invaded and wiped out almost all the snakes and lizards in the cave.
         Two species of tiny blind shrimps, <i>Parisia ungius</i> and <i>Parisia gracilis</i> also live in the cave.
         They are endemic for Australia and Madagascar, which is considered an evidence for continental drift.
      </p>

      <p class="indentedText">
         The climate in the northern part of Australia is tropical or subtropical, with a rainy season between January and April.
         As the caves are subject to flooding after heavy rains, there were always disturbances and the cave had to be closed weather dependent.
         An extremely high flood in 1998 actually convinced the management to change some details.
         Today the cave is completely closed during the wet season.
         This is rather unfortunate as this is late summer, the main tourist season on the Southern Hemisphere.
         The cave tours are operated by Nitmiluk Tours Pty Ltd., owned and operated by the local Jawoyn People, who also manage nearby Nitmiluk Gorge.
      </p>

      <p class="indentedText">
         <b>Cutta Cutta Caves Nature Park</b> covers 1.5 km² of karst landscape with open woodland and small clusters of rainforest thickets.
         The rocks are Tindal Limestone, a member of the Daly River Group formed on the eastern rim of the Daly Basin in the middle Cambrian period more than 500 Ma ago.
         The limestone forms karren and even stone forest like structures on th surface, which provides shelter for the wildlife during the heat of day and protection for fire sensitive plants and rainforest species.
         There are Hairy-fruited Banyan trees and other rainforest plants which grow in a dry landscape because their roots find water in the caves below.
