        <p>
            <b>Monte Sant'Angelo sul Gargano</b> is the name of a village, located at the
            southern coast of the Gargano peninsula, built on top of a mountain ridge which
            runs east to west.
            To the south there is a beautiful view to the sea 400m below, to the north is a
            steep cliff going down to a pleasant valley with some agriculture, and the
            National Park Foresta Umbra on the other side, a remains of the natural forests
            of Italy with typical mediterranean vegetation.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This pleasant spot was never a good place to settle, because of the steep cliffs
            all around, but it was used by sheperds to graze their sheep or goats or cows.
            Natural caves in the northern cliff face were used as shelter for the animals.
            The biggest of the caves was used as a shelter by the herders.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            According to legend the first appearance happened with a stray bull.
            The animal used to graze alone and avoid the other animals, and as it did not
            return to the barn one evening, the owner and his servants were looking for it.
            After some search they found it on top of the mountain, in front of a cave.
            At this time the owner was already so angry about the bull, he took his bow and
            shot at it with an arrow.
            But a strong and sudden wind turnd the arrow around and it hit the archer
            instead.
            He went to the bishop <b class="smallCaps">Lorenzo Maiorano</b> and told him the
            whole story.
            The bishop ordered three days of prayer and fasting, and at the end Archangel
            <b class="smallCaps">Michael</b> appeared and spoke:
            <i>"You have done well to ask God what was hidden to men.
                Make it clear that everything happens for my will as I am the Archangel <b
                        class="smallCaps">Michael</b>.
                The cave is sacred to me and I decided to protect this place and its
                inhabitants.
                What will be asked for in prayer will be answered here.
                Go to the mountain and dedicate the cave to Christian worship."</i>
            But the mountain was almost inaccessible and known as a place of pagan worship,
            so the bishop hesitated to obey the words of the Archangel.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The second appearance is traditionally dated to the year 492, but historically
            the battle between the Byzantines and the Lombards happened from 662 to 663.
            During this war the Greek attacked the shrine on the Gargano, which was defended
            by <b class="smallCaps">Grimoaldo I</b>, Duke of Benevento.
            In the night before the battle, the Archangel <b class="smallCaps">Michael</b>
            appeared again to the bishop <b class="smallCaps">Lorenzo Maiorano</b> and told
            him that his prayers would be answered.
            He was told to start the battle at the fourth hour of the day.
            When the Lombards did so, the battle was accompanied by earthquakes, lightning,
            and thunderbolts, and ended with the success of Grimoaldo.
            This day, the 08-MAY, became the feastday called the <b>Apparition of St.
            Michael</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In the year after the victory, bishop <b class="smallCaps">Maiorano</b> decided
            to obey the arcangel and consecrate a church inside the cave.
            The night before, he had the third appearance of the archangel who said:
            <i>"I have built the church [the cave] and I have consecrated it, this is not
                your task.
                But the people may come and frequent the place which is under my
                protection."</i>
            And so bishop <b class="smallCaps">Lorenzo Maiorano</b> and seven other bishops
            of Apulia walked to the shrine.
            Once inside the cave they found a crude altar covered by a crimson mantle and
            surmounted by a cross.
            In front of the altar was a footprint on the floor which was though to be from
            Arcangel <b class="smallCaps">Michael</b>.
            As a result of this day this cave is a church, which is not consecrated by human
            hands.
            It is called <b>Celeste Basilica</b> (heavenly basilica).
        </p>

        </table>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The fourth appearance happened in 1656, when Italy was hit by the plague.
            Archbishop <b class="smallCaps">Alfonso Puccinelli</b> went to the cave to pray
            and fast.
            At the dawn of 22-SEP-1656 he felt an earthquake and then St. Michael appeared
            to him.
            He ordered him to bless the stones of his cave carving on them the sign of the
            cross and the letters MA (Michael).
            Anyone who with such a stone would be saved from the plague.
            The city was was liberated from the plague and everyone who had such a stone
            survived too.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Today there is a sanctuary built on top of the cave.
            It is entered from the streets of the village on the top of the hill.
            There is an entrance building and a belfry.
            Inside the entrance a staircase starts, leading down to the level of the cave.
            An atrium leads to the entrance of the basilika with its bronze doors.
            The cave is located at the far end of the basilika.
            It contains the altar of St Michael and is used as a church until today.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At the foot of the staircase there is a second building on the other side, which
            contains a part of the original cliff face.
            It is full of artificial caves which were dug into the soft rock.
            They are interpreted as cells of hermits.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This place is actually a catholic church, and as such it is open daily and for
            free to all visitors.
            However, appropriate manners and clothing is expected, so bring decent shirts
            and shoes if you want to enter.
