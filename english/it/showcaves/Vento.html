        <h2>Description</h2>

        <table class="rightImg" width="250">
            <tr>
                <td><a data-ajax="false" target="_top" href="../../../images/Big/391-0097.jpg"><img alt="" src="../../../images/391-0097.jpg" width="250" height="175"></a></td>

        <p>
            <b>Grotta del Vento</b> (Wind Cave) has three natural entrances, at an altitude
            of 600m, 800m and 1400m asl.
            The height difference between the entrances and the temperature difference
            between inside and outside, create a convection stream of air!
            In winter the cave is warmer than outside, and as the warm air is lighter, it
            leaves the cave through the upper entrance.
            In summer the cave is colder than outside, and the cool air being heavier leaves
            the cave through the lower entrance.
            The speed of the air depends on the temperature difference between external and
            internal air.
            This stong air current is the reason for the name of cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At first only a narrow crevice was known, called <b>Buco Soffiante</b> (Blowing
            Hole) because of the air current.
            The cold air leaving the cave was used as refrigerator simply by building a hut
            on top of the crevice.
            The air temperature of 10°C is not low enough to cool food, a cellar would
            do the same.
            But the cavern air has much more carbon dioxide than outside air, and reduced
            oxigen.
            This added a second preserving effect and made the hut as effective as modern
            refrigerators.
            The hut from the 17th century existed until the beginning of World War II.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The lowest entrance of the cave system is the entrance for the cave tours.
            During tours an armoured door blocks the air current almost completely.
            This has about the same effect as the original situation around the entrance.
            A small brook, dry in summer, becomes a torrent each spring and filled the
            cave entrance long ago with rubble and earth.
            So only a small gap at the ceiling of the passage remained.
            This passage was often blocked, or extremely narrow, which made it difficult to
            explore.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave was first entered by a little girl, forced to do so by some local boys.
            But even the little girl was not able to crawl in very far.
            In 1932 the gap was widened by a flood, and an expedition of speleologists was
            able to get into the cave to a deep siphon.
            But they were not able to cross it, so the exploration ended after 70m.
            The cave seemed to be little promising.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            How much they erred was discovered in 1961, when another expedition tried to
            enter during low water.
            The siphon had fallen dry in this year and it was easy to wade through.
            The speleologist explored 600m of the cave on this first tour!
            Now the dam was broken, huge parts of the system were explored and soon the idea
            came up, to open the cave to the public.
            This required a way to avoid the siphon, so an artificial tunnel was built high
            above high water level.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A second important problem was the gravel in the entrance section.
            It was removed to built the path, but in 1996 a flood destroyed the entrance
            section, filled it with gravel, and destroyed the nearby ticket office.
            The entrance was reopened with bulldozers, a new ticket office built, but to
            avoid repeating destructions during future floods, the whole entrannce sectio
            was redesigned and protected by a massive concrete wall.
            This dam diverts the nearby brook and leads it directly into the valley
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The developed part of the cave shows three totally different cave sections.
            The first one has numerous beautiful speleothems, stalactites, shawls, and cave
            pearls.
            The second one is lower, at the bottom of a 45m deep pit, and sometimes water
            filled.
            It has no calcite speleothems but rather rare clay dripstones.
            The third part is above the entrance siphon.
            The narrow path winds up a steep and ragged shaft and shows an astounding
            vertical section of the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There are three cave tours, which last one, two and three hours.
            The short tour shows the speleothem-part, the two hour tour shows also the lower
            part with the clay dripstones.
            Only the three hour tour shows all three and really recommended for everyone who
            has enough time.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Most caves in Italy prohibit taking pictures with flash.
            But this cave is a honorable exception: they allow photography, as long as it
            does not disturb the tour.
            The cave is frequented very much by visitors, many of them from foreign
            countries.
            So tours are guided in several foreign languages like German, English, and
            French.
