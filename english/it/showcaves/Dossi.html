        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Grotta dei Dossi</b> is a show cave with a long history.
            It was discovered in 1797 and named after the nearby hamlet of Dossi, which is called <i>I Dòs</i> in Occitan.
            Many details about the discovery are known, including the exact date, but not the name of the discoverer.
            The cave was discovered on 13-MAR-1797 by a hunter who was following the tracks of a hare in the snow.
            He saw the animal slip into a hole in the ground, inserted his rifle into the hole and fired a few shots.
            He was convinced that he had wounded the prey, but was not willing to retrieve it, because the hole was quite narrow.
            So he convinced a boy to enter the cavity to bring him back the prey.
            The boy crawled into the narrow cavity and reached a large cave, when he saw the abyss he screamed in fear.
            Now the hunter entered the cave to help him, the two left the cave unharmed and had a great story to tell at the village.
            The details we know today are from a report written by abbot <b class="smallCaps">Pietro Nallino</b>, a scholar of local history and geography.
            He wrote down the story in all details, but omitted the names of the hunter and the boy.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            It was developed as a show cave in 1892, almost a century later, and it was the first cave with electric light in Italy.
            The <b>Società della Grotta dei Dossi</b> was a company which was formed for this purpose.
            The electricity was produced by a generator which powered 30 Edison lamps.
            Journalists from the major national and foreign newspapers came to Mondovì and wrote enthusiastic articles.
            The cave became quite popular, at that time the people had no electricity at home, electrification started years later, and so the cave was visited to see this light.
            Carriage trips were organized from Mondovì with guided tours in the cave, lunch, and an afternoon visit to the nearby sanctuary of Santa Lucia.
            But despite being noted for its speleothems, which were quite bright and colourful, when the novelty of electric light vanished, the visitor numbers to the cave dropped.
            The cave was not profitable any more, the installations were decaying, and World War I finally caused its closure.
            After the war, there was no interest in reopening the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave was closed for half a century, and unfortunately it was not well protected, so fragile speleothems were removed, stolen or destroyed.
            When it was reopened in the 1960s, the old paths and the light were no longer usable, and the development into a show cave had to start from scratch.
            Since then, the cave was continually open to the public.
            It is open only on Sundays, which makes it a cave with rather low visitor numbers, the reason is not the cave itself, but the fact that it is located off the beaten track.
            And despite the damages of the speleothems, there are still notable stalactites, stalagmites and rimstone pools.
            The cave is quite famous for its diverse and fragile cave life.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is located in Triassic dolomites on the north-western side of Monte Calvario (Mount Calvary).
            The plain around Cuneo ends on three sides with the foothills of the Alps.
            Mondovì is still in the plain at a height of about 530 m asl, but is surrounded by the hills which reach almost 800 m.
            The soluble rock and the elevation caused the karstification of the hills, which all drain underground.
            There are numerous small karst springs at the foot of the hills, where the water reappears.
            Pesio on the western side of the hills and Torrente Ellero on the eastern, as well as any other river in this plain, are tributaries of Po river.
