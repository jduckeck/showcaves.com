        <p>
            The <b>Buco del Piombio</b> (Lead Hole) is a river cave and resurgence.
            The water flows only during snow melt and after heavy rains out of the entrance
            portal, during other times the water trickles or my dry out completely.
            The huge entrance portal is of impressive dimensions, 45 meters high and 38
            meters wide, and this entrance hall is 40 m long.
            It is located at the foot of a vertical limestone cliff, which is a popular
            climbing area.
            The portal is visble from the plains below, from Erba and Albavilla.
            There is a historic building inside the portal, which has been renovated some
            years ago.
            It now contains the <b>Museo Buco del Piombo</b>, a small museum dedicated to
            the natural history of the area.

        <p class="indentedText">
            The name <b>Buco del Piombio</b> may be translated literally into lead hole.
            Actually, desite the name, there has never been lead inside the cave.
            The limestone of the cave walls has become grey by the growth of microorganisms
            on the surface.
            This colour resembles the colour of lead, and thats why this cave was named.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave system is located below the limestone ridge of Boletto mountain,
            actually the Alpe del Viceré on its southern side.
            This mountain ridge is up to 1,200 m asl high and mostly covered by forest, the
            upper region is used as alpine pasture land.
            The mountain consists of Cretaceous limestones of the Maiolica formation, a
            compact white limestone, well stratified with inclusions of chert or flint.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is the drainage system of this ridge, but the portal is not the main
            resurgence any more.
            The situation of this cave is typical and explained by the following model.
            The area is in continuous uplift, so the drainage cuts into the rock continualy
            lowering the valleys.
            Cave systems form and drain to the current level of outside drainage, but when
            this is lowered, a deeper level of caves is formed, draining towards this new
            drainage level.
            However, when the lower level is still young and the passages are small, the
            upper level is reactivated periodically when the production is too high.
            In other words, the water flows only during snow melt and after heavy rains out
            of the entrance portal.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This cave was known to mankind for a very long time.
            The entrance contained remains from the Moustérien like flint tools.
            It seems the cave was visited by hunters periodically.
            A deposit of cave bear bones was called <b>Banco degli Orsi</b> after its
            discovery and shows the cave was visited by cave bears (<i>Ursus spelaeus</i>)
            some 20,0000 yeras ago.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave was again used by man during the late Roman period, between 300 and 500
            AD.
            During the Middle Ages the cave was fortified by the construction of a large
            building which blocked the entrance.
            The beam holes in the wall are still visible, they were used to hold the wooden
            floors.
            The cave was used for several centuries as a shelter for the inhabitants of
            Erba, during times of war or disease.
            Today there is a small exhibition, a café and the ticket office inside
            the renovated entrance building.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave was frequently visited during history, and there are engravings,
            paintings, and postcards to prove this.
            During the frst half of the 20th century it was guided as a show cave, but
            actually it was developed as a show cave in 1953 with the installation of
            electric light.
            But in 1966 a flood destroyed the installations and the show cave was closed.
            It was possible to visit the cave on your own with a torch, but there was no
            operator any more.
            A poor situation for the cave, as it may be subject to vandalizm, but it seems
            this cave, being a river caver cave, never had many speleothems.
            The cave is private property so the visits were actually trespassing, but it
            seems they happend.
            Later the area became a natural park and various locations were both protected
            and developed for visitors.
            As a result the interest in this historic and geologic place awoke.
            After an agreement was found between the city of Erba and the owner, the cave
            was reopened in 1998.
            Today the cave is very well developed with paths and staircases built of natural
            rocks.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is rather difficult to reach, one of the reasons why it never was a
            success as a show cave.
            There are two possible ways.
            The official way is to drive to Albavilla and follow the signs to the former
            restaurant Cascina Zoccolo.
            From the center follow the Via Cesare Cant&ugrave; towards Castelmarte, at the
            Trattoria Alpina turn left onto Via Buco del Piombo.
            At Cascina Ginocchio keep left, at Cascina Zoccolo the paved road ends with a
            parking lot.
            It is already high above Elba and the trail from here is actually the
            continuation of the road, a dirt road which leads to the cave.
            This is about 30 minutes walk.
            The second way to the cave is through the Val Bova, which starts about 700m
            north of the Trattoria Alpina.
            There is a trail along the valley and after about two kilometers a trail to the
            left leading up to the cave.
            In both cases it is necessary to climb a staircase with 155 stone steps to reach
            the cave entrance
            So actually you should always plan a walk of more than one hour in addition to
            the cave visit.
            Clothes and shoes appropriate for the walk are fine for the cave too, but bring
            a sweater as the cave is rather cool.
        </p>
