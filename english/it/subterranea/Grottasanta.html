        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The church <b>Maria SS. Addolorata a Grottasanta</b> (Our Lady of Sorrows Grottasanta) is located in the city Syracuse, in the northeastern quarter named Mazzarona.
            The church is an average italian church, except probably for the "grotto" in the name.
            It is a reference on the <b>Grotta Santa</b> (Holy Grotto) on the site.
            The entrance is located at the northeastern corner of the churchyard and may be reached from the churchyard down a staircase, or from the Via Grotta Santa.
            Unfortunately the cave church is not open to the public most of the time, it is open only during events which take place in the cave church.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b class="smallCaps">Giuseppe Veneziano</b> was born in Augusta between 1544 and 1548, his exact birthdate is unknown.
            His father took him to Syracuse when he was still a child and they both worked as carpenters.
            But they were no regular carpenters, they were caulkers, which built boats from wood.
            He never went to church, but he received a sound moral and religious education from his parents.
            He was particularly devoted to Saint <b class="smallCaps">Joseph</b>, with whom he shared the firstname and the profession.
            After the death of his parents in 1585, he married <b class="smallCaps">Margherita</b>.
            He had 13 children, 12 boys and a girl, of whom 4 became priests, while the others married.
            He was very religious.
            But when he became a widower and was no longer able to work due to his advanced age, he decided to dedicate the last years of his life entirely to serving God.
            He retired to a secluded cave in Cozzo Romito, about two miles from the city of Syracuse and lived as a hermit.
            He was so strong in his belief and his prayers, that people started to visit him in his cave and pray with him, mostly local farmers.
            Finally, he was visited regularly by 150 people and the cave was too small.
            The Venetian decided to speak to the Bishop, Monsignor <b class="smallCaps">Francesco Elia Rossi</b>, who approved the congregation, under the name <b>Congregation of Jesus and Mary</b> on 18-JUN-1643.
            He finally dies at an age around 100 years, and was buried inside the church of Jesus and Mary.
            He had actually wished to be buried underground without a tombstone under a road or path, so that every trace of him would be lost.
            And this happened, as if the Lord wanted to fulfill his last wish.
            The traces of his tomb were lost, all documents about his life as well, and all documents of the curia too.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave church was forgotten for some time, but from 1680 it was a place of prayer again.
            In 1728 an altar was erected for the celebration of Holy Mass every Friday, so the cave became a “devout sanctuary”.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Another important person in the history of the cave was Sister <b class="smallCaps">Chiara</b>, who was formerly named <b class="smallCaps">Adelaide Di Mauro</b> (*1890-✝1932).
            After being widowed, she decided to live as a hermit in the cave.
        </p>
