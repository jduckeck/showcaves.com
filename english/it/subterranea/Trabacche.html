        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Grotta delle Trabacche</b> (Trabacche Cave) is a catacombe, which is an artificial underground space with numerous niches which was used as graveyard.
            Most catacombs were Christian catacombs, used by Christians during the times when they were an illegal religion, and they were prosecuted.
            Underground they were able to bury their dead in peace and unknown from the authorities.
            This catacomb is different in the sense that it was an official graveyard, after the religion had been officially allowed.
            Nevertheless, it was a Christian cememtery.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Iblea</b> limestone plateau between Ragusa, Comiso and the sea is a place which was settled since the Greek era, and there were numerous ancient settlements.
            This catacomb was dated to the 4th century, which is actually after the persecution of Christians, so it was just the common way to bury people at that time.
            Two large adjacent rooms have graves in the floor and the walls, so-called arcosol tombs.
            It consists of a hypogeum of two large adjoining chambers, where two mighty so-called "canopy" sarcophagi decorated with rows of columns stand.
            There are in the walls and other tombs are clearly visible, although they are below ground level. Unfortunately, there are no traces of frescoes
            There are also two huge sarcophagi with columns which were the graves of very important or very respected people.
            In Sicilian, the term <i>trabacca</i> means a bed adorned with curtains, the cave was named after the two monolithic sarcophagi which resemble such a bed.
            They are generally called <i>canopy sarcophagi</i>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There are two more interesting details about the caves.
            First, there is a small side passage which has nice erosional forms on the wall.
            In other words, it is a natural cave, while the main chambers are obviously artificial, whith straight walls, ceiling and floor.
            The only possible explanation is that it was originally a natural cave that was massively remodelled for the cemetery.
            Probably the reason why this site is called <b>Grotta delle Trabacche</b> and not <b>Catacombe delle Trabacche</b>.
            And the second detail is a vertical shaft through the ceiling to the surface.
            It allows a sort of airflow, wind blowing into the entrance goes out the shaft, also there might be some convection.
            The obvious result is that the air in the cave is drier than in normal caves, and while it was still used as a cemetery, the bodies were most likely mummified.
            This is just speculation, but other famous sites with mummified bodies we have listed on <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span>, work exactly in this way.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Most descriptions call the main chambers
            <a target="_top" href="../../../english/explain/Subterranea/Hypogeum.html"><img alt="Subterranea" class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Subterranea.png">Hypogeum</a>,
            which is a common term in southern Italy and on Malta, but unfortunately it is completely wrong.
            The term is normally used for pagan cult sites, specifically temples or tombs, but this is a Christian catacomb.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This site has some touristic history.
            During the 17th and 18th century, the middle and northern European nobles and scholars started to travel to Italy, the land of history and culture.
            By the British it was called the <b>Grand Tour</b>, <b class="smallCaps">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</b> wrote his book <b>Italienreise</b> about his own journey.
            <b class="smallCaps">Jean Houel</b>, who traveled to Italy and visited Naples, Sicily, Malta and Lipari island in 1776 published four books with 146 drawings.
            He visited this site and created a description and drawings.
            As a result, the site was visited by others doing the <b>Grand Tour</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The site has also some recent fame.
            It was the filming location for an episode of <b>Il Commissario Montalbano</b>, a quite popular Italian crime series, named <b>Cane di Terracotta</b> (The Terracotta Dog).
            In the movie the bodies of a pair of lovers are found right here, together with a terracotta dog.
            Unlike other tv series, this is a series of full length movies, between two and four per year.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The site is gated with an iron bar gate, which seems to be to keep animals out.
            There is a simple latch, please remember to close the door when you leave.
            The same with the gates along the walk from the car park to the entrance.
        </p>
