        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Criptoportico Forense</b> (Forensic Cryptoporticus) is a horseshoe or U shaped underground passage with barrel vaulted openings in the middle of the passage separating it into two parallel passages.
            The site is quite exceptional and obviously of Roman origin, and it is located in the middle of the Roman district of the city Aosta, between the Roman theater and the ruins of the Roman city wall and baths.
            Together with the
        </p>

        <!-- todo
        From the garden that opens onto Piazza Giovanni XXIII, you enter the Forensic Cryptoporticus, a monumental building that delimited a sacred area dedicated to worship. It is a basement building with a quadrangular horseshoe shape, consisting of a double corridor with barrel vaults supported by sturdy pillars in travertine limestone blocks, finely plastered and illuminated by lancet windows.
        The monument datable to the Augustan period must have constituted a containment and regularization structure of the land which in that area of ​​the city had to be slightly sloping from north to south and created a difference in height between the sacred area and the adjacent forensic stalls. In addition to the function of support, it is hypothesized that the basement could also serve as a warehouse and military granary, while the probable marble colonnade that overlooked it, which has now
        disappeared, served as a scenographic frame for the temples of the sacred area.
        The refurbishment works carried out in the early years of the new millennium made the Cryptoporticus almost entirely viable, which due to the excellent conservation conditions and the architectural space of great visual appeal is one of the main archaeological sites of Augusta Prætoria.

        A suggestive area
        Within the forensic complex, the architectural structures of the Cryptoporticus delimited and artificially raised the sacred area.
        The semi-buried structure, which can be dated back to the Augustan period, did indeed support a portico surrounding the two temples standing at the centre.
        The best preserved monumental remains of the entire Forum take the shape of an articulated building lit by splayed windows evenly spaced along the internal walls.
        The internal space is characterised by two parallel galleries centrally supported by pillars made of local limestone, connected by arcades and covered with barrel vaults.
        The plastered perimeter walls are built of split pebbles, while it is uncertain what the flooring was composed of due to prolonged reuse of these spaces, for example as a storage area during the Middle
        Ages and fractioned into cellars throughout the 19 th and up to the early 20 th century.
        The present
        Cryptoporticus entrance area (the original one was on the north- south gallery axis) dates back to reconditioning and restoration work carried out by regional supervisor Ernesto Schiaparelli approximately a century ago and closely conforms to the surface level used during the
        Roman era, as testified by the presence of a drainage channel in limestone blocks skirting the building’s internal perimeter.
        The Twin Temples
        Of the twin temples standing at the centre of the area, the perimeter foundations of the podium on which they both rested still survives, while only the long eastern side of the east temple survives of the opus quadratum facade in local limestone, and which can be seen beneath the
        Archdeaconry building (today ACLI offices).
        At a late stage, during the 3 rd -4 th centuries, the underground structure’s function changed, perhaps since storage room was required for the goods traded in nearby forensic shops.
        After having been stripped of its facings and precious construction elements, this monumental part of the city was used again in the
        Middle Ages, when a residential area developed around the cathedral, that was built at the end of the 4 th century, on a previous Roman domus.
