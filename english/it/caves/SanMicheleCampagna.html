        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The <b>Eremo di San Michele</b> (hermitage of St Michael) is a small Benedictine
            monastery built into an overhanging cliff of the Monti Picentini.
            It is far from roads, the only way to reach it is by hiking, for example from
            Puglietta, which is actually a part of Campagna.
            The hermitage is located about 1,000m asl, so it is quite an ascent from the
            400m asl high village.

        Inside the church is a tomb built in the sixteenth century ,
        connected to it are joined in the rock three small rooms, a chapel and a kitchen
        mortar and stones. Carfagno on the crest of this tomb is unique, as depicted by
        a vepre, a heraldic representation rare in Italy and more common in northern
        Europe. [2].

        From 1630 the chapel underwent restoration and expansion. In 1748
        he was placed a stone cross with a column, the three basic steps, paved on the
        front of the entrance of the hermitage was built and the whole staircase railing
        with her ??sixty steps. Inside are kept some of the marble tablets of the Cross
        raised in 1672. Today the monastery of San Michele has eight small rooms, five
        kitchens and a refectory. Among the main visitors of the past should definitely
        be mentioned Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz (bishop from 1658 to 1673), the creator
        of the first table that Binary Numbering testimony of his passing he carved a
        stone, which still exists today.

        The hermitage of San Michele is contained in the hollow of a 'high cliff, which
        has the shape of a shell, and overlooks the large and picturesque valley below.

        According to legend the cave <b>San Michele a Montenero</b> was the home of the Devil.
        In the 10th century, on an 08-MAY, the day of St. Micheal, the Archangel showed up in disguise.


         tradition, the cave of St. Michael in Montenero was the
        Devil, since the above areas were inhabited. In the tenth century, during the
        feast of St. Michael in May, soon showed up in the morning S. Michael, as a
        stranger, and wanted to visit the cave, saying the Devil to be a pastor.
        The distinguished visitor visited each place before he left the mountain and
        took four stones and placed them on the ground in the form of a cross.

        The Devil, uttering piercing screams, ran up to Lauropiano chased by S. Michael
        and filling the area of ??shrill cries, which echoed dreadfully for the wide
        valleys and in the form of sound of resounding arms extended and repeated the
        night still. S. Michael took such possession of the cave and wanting to learn
        from an anonymous Puglietta cowherd, who grazed cows on Toppole, meant that a
        young bull went into the cave, although the narrow road to go there would be
        impracticable, and would begin to roar. The pastor, the day after, she heard
        him, and hardly managed to get there.

        The bull did not move and growled continuously. The cowherd, before you get
        there, then where was built the altar, he saw a bright young, so he stopped and
        was astonished eyes on the ground. The pastor immediately ran to Puglietta,
        after easily saved the young bull, and told what had happened to the religious
        authorities of Puglietta.

        Since then the cave, dug into a steep rock and full of cliffs, acquired such
        importance that it is decided to Cimiliarca Puglietta of a permanent home for
        three hermits, as a monastery, for the cult of St. Michele Arcangelo. The news
        of the apparition of St. Michele is scattered everywhere and the cave soon
        became a place of frequent pilgrimages, interrupted only by war.

        In the second half of the tenth century, following the circulation of the
        apparition of St. Michele, in various countries spread among the people the
        conviction to live a very strict ascetic life, he acquired a concept of absolute
        repudiation of the life of luxury and a poor approach to the spirit of the
        Gospel.

        Many retreated to isolated and lonely caves, frequented only by shepherds and
        woodsmen, to spend an ascetic life devoid of pomp and earthly goods. So, towards
        the end of the tenth century, by order of religious authority, were assigned to
        three hermits living in the cave between prayer and harsh penance.
        It was a time when many hermits lived in caves in St. Elmo and Alburni.
        Soon, the three were joined by two other hermits. Their holiness is scattered
        everywhere and people came from Puglietta, from Oliveto Citra, from Contursi and
        Countryside. The hermitage acquired great importance, since they lived as
        hermits in a small Benedictine monastery, by having too many bequests from many
        people.

        The early church was very small, with the local rough behind, where they slept
        on hard beds. The church was finished in 1257, while other rooms were isolated
        from the rest of the mountain with a strong fence to prevent wolves and other
        animals from entering the cave. The small church was also the grave below. After
        church, the hermits, to reconcile the frequency of people, the administration of
        estates and had a life of penance, they built other smaller premises.

        During the feasts of St. Michele, on May 8 and September 29, a hermit, which
        until the early years of the seventeenth century he was never alone, sat on the
        left of the entrance, just after the main gate, and lashed the people to do
        penance for their sins, considering 14 Stations of the Cross along the stairway
        to the door of the church.

        The marble tablets of the 14 Stations of the Cross, located to the left of the
        climber and made by order of Bishop G. Caramuele in May of 1672, today there are
        more, because some were stolen, others with gun shots ruined by ignorant and
        incredulous soldiers during the era of brigandage, others are kept by the
        current directors.

        When the church was enlarged in the early sixteenth century, the hermits did
        fresco by a monk of St. Avigliano Mary of the interior of the niche, where he
        had made a rough ride for the statue of St. Michael the constant moisture.

        Since then, the Franciscans of Avigliano celebrated Mass at St. Michael for a
        long time. The road leading to Montenero, for those of Countryside, passing near
        the convent of S. Mary of Avigliano and you could go either on foot or by mule,
        while those who had lived in for Puglietta Arenola, Valledacera, Lauropiano.
        Shortly before arriving at Trigento on the right, carved into the river gorge,
        there is a cave called the Devil's calabrittano or, because during the time of
        the robbery was a man of Calabritto killed by robbers, who took a while
        Calabritto went to work.

        They did die hanging from the ceiling of the cave. Around this cave the popular
        imagination has given birth to many legends, including that of a hypothetical
        treasure for which, wishing to take place should kill a child.
        The fresco representing the Madonna, with the right S. Michael S. and left
        Antonino, altered several times for moisture, was completely covered in the
        early seventeenth century and was placed a statue of St. Michele in 1605 to work
        among the hermit John Spagnuolo, who also made a statue of colored chalk S.
        Antonino.

        Around 1630 he built a new kitchen for the devotees, who during the two annual
        festivals flocked more and more.
        The last hermit who lived in St. Michael was John Spagnuolo, buried under the
        church as all those that lived up to that time.
        In 1748 representatives of the chapter, Cervone, Samnites and Filiuli, erected a
        stone cross with a column, the three basic steps, all on paved front 'entrance
        of the hermitage. The cross, for the strong wind, many times you fall, but has
        always been raised, as it did well in 1901.

        In the same period was built the whole staircase railing with her sixty steps.
        The date is still visible near the door of the church, at the top of the stairs.
        In 1796 they built the two arcs of quartinetto less, to strengthen the upper
        quart already built, which is reached by a short staircase and a small corridor,
        which gives rise to five small rooms, and ends on the vault of the Church, used
        as a tower with two small bells.

        In front of the first room, designed as a refectory, there are two other
        kitchens with bathtub carved in live rock, to collect water dripping from the
        mountain itself, which therefore bears the name of Water St. Michael, and an
        open space at the side of conversation outdoors.
        Today the Hermitage of S. Michael has eight small rooms, five kitchens and a
        refectory.
