        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Kanioni i Osumit</b> (Osum Gorge) is also known as <b>Kanionet e Osumit Zabërzan</b> (Canyons of Osum Zabërzan).
            The gorge has a length of 13 km with six narrow sections ranging from 4 m wide in the riverbed up to 35 m wide further up.
            Quite spectacular are the frequent vertical, almost pillar-like limestone cliffs with horizontal bedding.
            The deepest parts of the gorge are between 70 m and 80 m deep.
            The two parts of the gorge we describe here are the two most spectacular deep sections which are also easily accessible.
            They are located between Çorovoda and Zabërzan.
            There is the local road SH72 along the gorge on the northern side.
            On the southern side there is at least at the second part of the canyon a single lane gravel road on the southern side.
            The other four sections are not that easily accessible.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Quite exceptional is the fact that spring is the best time to visit the gorge.
            During snow melt, the water level is high, and it is possible to explore the whole gorge from the river.
            This is quite exceptional as most other gorges are not accessible during high water.
            This gorge has rapids of Class II, which means they can be navigated without prior white water experience.
            Physical fitness and the ability to swim, plus appropriate equipment, are obviously required.
            There are tour operators who offer various such white water tours in the canyon.
            The local operator is Albanian Adventure Resort (AAR) who offer different tours around the year, depending on the water level.
            When the water level is too low, the gorge can be walked through, with some narrow sections where it is necessary to swim.
            That's actually not unpleasant with high temperatures and an almost optimal water temperature for refreshing.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            However, if you are not fond of canyoning or white water rafting, there are nevertheless numerous possibilities to see the spectacular gorge.
            First of all there are several bridges across, which offer a great view, and then there are parking lots with outlooks.
            When you drive southeast from Çorovoda on SH72 it goes up a hillside and then follows the rim of the gorge.
            Its possible to stop at the road in Çerenisht and 500 m after the village, but the official car park with outlook is 1 km after the village.
            There is a platform with steel railing offering a great view into a steep and narrow section of the gorge.
            About 6.9 km from Çorovoda there is a turnoff to the right, a single-lane road crosses the gorge on a bridge which offers a great view.
            Another kilometer down the road the steep section has ended, and another turnoff at the right leads down to the river.
            This is one of the places where the boat tours start.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Another 1.5 km further down the road the next narrow section of the gorge starts.
            Here is a restaurant and the starting point of a trail through the gorge.
            After a few hundred meters it crosses the river on a bridge named <b>Ura e Vjetër e Zabërzanit</b> (The Old Bridge of Zabërzan).
            The short hike offers a great view, and the restaurant afterwards offers a reward for the effort.
            This second narrow section ends after another 1.3 km when the road crosses the gorge on a bridge.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Vrima e Nusës</b> (Bride Hole) is located 800 m from the village of Bigazi.
            The small karst cave has a length of 8m and is about 2 m wide and high.
            It was named after a legend.
        </p>

        <p class="foreign">
            A bride was to be married off against her will.
            The Khrushks took her to another village and guarded her.
            They ignored her complaints that she was being taken to her husband against her will.
            As a result, she devised her own escape plan.
            She prayed to God and turned to the rock of the ravine: "Open yourself, O rock, so that I can free you from the shame that has overtaken me."
            And the rock heard her and opened a hollow.
            The bride jumped off her horse and hid in the hole.
            The Khrushchaks returned to the village without her.
            Later, this cave was visited by young brides who wanted to have children.
        </p>

        <p class="">
            The <b>Mulliri i Babait</b> (Father's Mill) is located near Hambul, and used the water for the river to grind grain.
            The canal is about 4-5 m deep and 150 m long.
            It's possible to walk along the canal, but the mill is destroyed.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Near the village of Dhores, about 5 km from Çorovoda is a strange erosional form, which resembles the track of a horse and a stick.
            According to legend, these are the footprints of the saint <b class="smallCaps">Abaz Ali</b>, who came to Tomor from Karbala, riding on his white horse.
            He flew on his horse to this spot, leaving the trail, and then flew to Mount Tomori.
        </p>
