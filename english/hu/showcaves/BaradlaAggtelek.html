        <p>
            The <b>Baradla-barlang Aggtelek lejárat</b> (Baradla Cave Aggtelek exit) is the traditional section of the cave.
            This is the entrance which has been known to man for millennia, and which bears archaeological remains.
            It is located at the foot of a 51 m high white cliff that overlooks the edge of the village.
            The entrance area at the foot of the Baradla and Aggtelek cliffs was occupied by Neolithic man around 7,000 BP.
            It was again visited during the Late Bronze Age, and there are also remains from the Middle Ages, around the 13th century.
            A section is named <b>Bone House</b> because it contained a large number of bones, first reported by <b class="smallCaps">Keresztély Raisz</b>.
            He was a surveyor and the creator of the first accurate map of the Baradla Cave in 1801.
            He guessed that these were the remains of people who had fled there during the Tatar invasion and died of hunger.
            Other theories were that these were the victims of robbers, who dragged them here and deposited the dead bodies.
            But soon it became obvious that these were animal bones.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave was regularly visited over centuries, there were explorations, surveys and even touristic visits.
            But there is no exact year when the cave actually became a show cave.
            The first written mention of the cave dates back to 1549, a description of a visit to the cave which was actually published in Basel, Switzerland.
            The first survey was carried out in 1794 by <b class="smallCaps">József Sartory</b>, a Hungarian surveyor.
            The first printed drawing of the cave was a map made by <b class="smallCaps">Keresztély Raisz</b> in 1801, which was published in 1807.
            He explored and surveyed 1.8 km, obviously quite extensive for this time, nevertheless only a small part of the cave.
            At the same time there were also the first tourist visits, the most spectacular was obviously the visit by <b class="smallCaps">József Nádor</b> in 1806.
            For this purpose some development works were carried out, including the construction of trails, bridges and lamp holders were installed.
            Afterwards the wooden structures were not maintained and soon rotted and collapsed.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At this time the Vaskapu, a sort of harmless sump, was the impenetrable end of the passage.
            It was penetrated by <b class="smallCaps">Imre Vass</b> in 1825, and he explored another 5 km of cave passages.
            He surveyed the new sections and published his results in Hungarian and German in 1831.
            He became the most important explorer of the Baradla cave.
            He was very competent and committed, but he was also lucky that several years of drought had lowered the water level in many sections of the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b class="smallCaps">Robert Townson</b>, an English naturalist, physician, and member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh visited the cave in 1793.
            He described his visit and published it in London 1793, his book was quite popular and had three French and two Dutch editions.
            Considered the most important information about Hungary for decades it had a great influence on other travellers visiting the cave.
            This importance for the cave was the reason why a bronze plate was installed on a rock in front of the cave entrance.
            In the first half of the 19th century there were numerous visits by travelers from all over Europe and numerous reports were published.
            In other words, the cave was already quite popular at that time.
        </p>

            On the other hand, the cave was not a show cave, although some trails were built quite early, and "There are several people in the village who are used to guiding strangers around this underground labyrinth."
            At that time torches and candles were used.
            But the wooden installations soon rotted away or were destroyed by floods.
            The beginning as a show cave was probably the takeover by the Hungarian Carpathian Association (MKE) in 1881.
            They built a hut in front of the cave entrance as infrastructure.
            They also started to build an artificial entrance as a way to implement a through trip.
            This was at Vörös-tó and was started in 1885.
            At the same time the cave facilities wer renovated: the bridges and trails were repaired, the passage leading to Paradicsom was widened, and the Münnich passage was completed.
            As a result, the cave was now accessible all year round, regardless of floods.
            The Vörös-tó entrance was completed in 1892 with a house next the artificial entrance, and through trips were offered.
            This was probably the first time the cave was actually open to the public as a show cave.
            Unfortunately, this lasted only a short time.
            The chairman of the association, the caretaker and the first director of the show cave died in a short period, and the cave became ownerless.
            The MKE department of Putnok was still responsible, but they were far away and not interested in managing the cave.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Once again run down and without actual management the cave was finally declared a national treasure in 1925 by the Minister of Culture.
            He also provided a large amount of aid for its renovation.
            As a result 1,800 m of concrete trails, stone steps, and 104 smaller and larger concrete bridges were constructed.
            At the same time water supply, telephone line, electricity, and a new road were built to the cave.
            But there were numerous irregularities, and so the management was taken away from the MKE entrusted to the Borsod-Gömör-Kishont County Deputy Governor, and subsequently to the Hungarian Tourist Association.
            This is the reason why generally the opening as a show cave is dated to 1935.
            In this year the cave lighting was installed and the Baradla Great Committee entrusted the well-known speleology expert, <b class="smallCaps">Hubert Kessler</b>.

            The tour at the Aggtelek entrance is more or less the historic tour, there are numerous plates made of limestone or bronze commemorating the various researchers.
            The Visitor center is also located here, and there is a restaurant and a hotel nearby.
            In other words it’s a good idea to start your visit here.
            The cave is entered at the foot of the limestone cliff, a huge passages with piles of debris follow.
            There are some speleothems by only isolated groups of stalagmites and stalactites.
            The cave is in general not very well decorated.
            And the walls show the soot of the centuries of cave visits with torches and candles, producing soot.
            The highlight of the tour is the <b>Concert Hall</b>, a huge chamber which was used for concerts for many years.
            There is also a tour with a boat ride, but it requires a certain level of water in the river Styx, which did not happen for several years.
            It seems the boat trips were discontinued by global warming.
            This part of the cave offers speleothems in extraordinary colours, blackish stalactites protruding from a red and green coloured ceiling.

            The cave extends across the political boundary to the Slovak Republic, about 5.000 m of this system lies beneath Slovakian territory.
            Another part of the same cave system is a fourth show cave, under the name

            on the other side of the border.
            This traverse is today, after the end of the Cold War, not a problem any more.
            The remnants of the metal gates which once formed an underground borderline are visible but defunct.
            The tour is impressive, but following stream passages, climbing through rimstone pools and

            is strenuous and includes getting wet.
            This tours is possible after appointment, but it requires the physical ability and appropriate gear like rubber boots, caver’s overall, helmet, waterproof lamps, and gloves.

                The Baradla Cave is the most significant, the most studied, the longest, the richest cave not only in this region, but also in Hungary itself.
                Its activity, its length, and its stalactites and stalagmites make it the most prominent cave in the temperate zone.

                The first major construction project was carried out in 1806, when <b class="smallCaps">Palatine Joseph</b> visited the cave.
                The number of visitors increased due to the photographs and picture postcards issued from the end of the last century on.
                The cave was managed by the <b>Magyar Kárpát Egyesület</b> (Hungarian Carpathian Society) at this time.

                Further attempts to enhance tourism were initiated in the 1920s.
                The Jósvafõ exit, and the inside bridges were completed.
                These are still used.
                The most impressive change happened when the electric system was built, and the visited sections were illuminated.
