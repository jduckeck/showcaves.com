        <h2>History</h2>


        <h2>Geology</h2>

        <p>
            The limestone was deposited during the late Jurassic (155 Ma), in a shallow warm sea which was part of the Thetys.
            The flint formation is actually based on biological processes.
            The soft mud on the sea floor was inhabited by crustaceans, crabs and shrimps, which dug extensive networks of caves and passages for living.
            They stored plants inside, which were decaying, in other words colonies of bacteria lived in them, which in turn were the food for the larvae of the crustaceans.
            But they also changed the pH of the water in the tunnels, just by feeding and releasing byproducts into the water.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The groundwater percolating through the only partly solidified sediment was seawater from above, which contains dissolved quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>) in low amounts.
            The solution and precipitation of quartz depends strongly on the pH of the water.
            Inside the acidic environment of the tunnels, quartz was precipitated.
            So the water deposited the quartz in the form of a gel which gradually filled the tunnels.
            Most likely the time when the crustaceans decided to dig new tunnels somewhere else.
            And as long as there was a different pH in the area. the process continued, even after the tunnels were filled completely with quartz.
            The results are layers of intricate and a fantastic shapes, often forming layers of some extent, which probably represent the extension of the original tunnels.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The limestone rock is a rather soft and very white limestone which is often called chalk.
            Some qualities were actually used to cut blackboard chalk.
            But the rather soft limestone made digging much easier than hard limestone would have.
            And it was nevertheless very stable, there was not muh danger of a collapse.
        </p>


        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Prahistoryczne Kopalnie Krzemienia w Krzemionkach</b> (Archaeological Museum and Reserve „Krzemionki”) or short <b>Krzemionki</b> is a neolithic flint mine, located in eastern Poland, not far from the border to the Ukraine.
            The mine tunnels which were dug 5000 years ago in the hunt for best quality flint are perfectly preserved.
            The quality here was so high, it was mostly used to produce smoothed axe blades.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The area of Poland was covered by the glaciers from Scandinavia until about 10,000 to 8,000 years BP.
            The melting water left huge river systems, lakes and swamps.
            The vegetation started with the rise of the temperature and the former steppe became birch forest.
            Animals and humans migrated into the area and lived there.
            8,000 years BP Poland was populated by tribes coming in from beyond the Carpathian Mountains.
            They were not hunter and gatherers, they were early farmers.
            Land was deforested by burning the trees to be used for cultivation.
            They domesticated various animals.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This was also the time of advanced techniques in flint processing.
            Polished battle-axes were made from different types of stone and pierced to mount on handles.
            Knives, points, sickles and other smaller tools were broduced, but also blades longer than 20 cm.
            The resources were found in the rivers and at the shores of the Baltic Sea.
            The flint, which was in the chalk, remained when the chalk was weathered and eroded.
            Unfortunately it got cracks in this process, especially due to freezing in winter.
            They soon discovered that flint they found underground hab better quality, and soon the flint was mined.
            First in pits, then in shafts, and finally in tnnel protruding from the bottom of the shaft.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The flint rich chalk covers much of Europe, from the cliffs of Dover to Poland, and there are flint mines all over.
            Rather big and well-preserved are those at Krzemionki and Świeciechów.
            At Krzemionki the findings included a community which supported the mining.
            It tells about long distance trade and the use of carts, and the domestication of horses.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The site is visited on two hours guided tours, which include an underground tour into the prehistoric mine tunnels.
            This is quite exceptional, other flint mines can not offer underground tours due to security problems.
            But the tunnels here are very stable even after 5000 years.
            However, most of the tour is above the ground walking through the forest to various excavation sites and reconstructed buildings.
            The site is also a site of experimental archaeology, and numerous structures which were excavated have been reconstructed.
        </p>
