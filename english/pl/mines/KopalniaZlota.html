            The old gold mine at the village Zloty Stok houses the <b>Podziemne Muzeum "Kopalnia Zlota" w Zlotym Stoku</b> (Underground Museum of Mining and Gold Metallurgy).
            There are also two mine tunnels open to the public, the <b>Czarna</b> gallery which shows the 16th century hand-excavated tunnels and the <b>Gertruda</b> tunnel with an underground waterfall.
            There is als an underground exhibition of old mining tools.
            Back on the surface there is an interesting mineral exhibition.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Zloty Stok is located in the Golden Mountains, which is the local name of this part of the Sudetes mountain range.
            According to local legend the gold mining started already in the 7th century, but the first documented evidence is from the 13th century.
            Even though this is Poland’s oldest gold mine.
            During the Hussite wars in the early 15th century the mine was destroyed, mining ended.
            It was started again by Prince <b class="smallCaps">Henryk Starszy Podiebradowicz</b> at the end of the 15th century.
            Then the mining rights were given to the village Zloty Stok.
            During the 16th century were the heydays of the mine, which brought prosperity to the village.
            Foreign investors, mostly from Germany, boosted the mining further.
            At this time the mine produced some 150kg of gold per year, which was 8% of all European gold production.
            During the 17th century the mining was imporved by the introduction of gunpowder, formerly the ore was heated with fire and cooled with water so it cracked and could easily be removed.
            Unfortunately the arsenic in the ore evaporated and caused an early death of most miners.
            But the <b>30 Years War</b> put an end to the mining and almost deserted the town.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The next important development started in the mid 17th century.
            <b class="smallCaps">Hans Scharffenberg</b>, a chemist form Vienna, discovered the use and methods for the extraction of arsenic.
            His sons completed his work and in the early 18th century the mine started to produce arsenic as well as gold.
            In this early time the price of arsenic was three times the price of gold.
            During the <b>Prussian-Austrian War</b> mining stopped again and was started once more in 1770.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In the mid 19th century the usage of chloride for the extraction of the gold was discovered and was a breakthrough for the local gold production.
            The whole mine was purchased by the German <b class="smallCaps">Wilhelm Guttler</b> in 1883.
            He developed the mine and introduced new technologies including the mining railroad, steam engines for pumping water, ventilation and drills powered by compressed air.
            In the early 20th century the production of arsenic reached its peak of nearly 2400 tonnes per year, which was 20% of the world production.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            After World War II the ownership of the mine was transferred to the Polish government, the mine was unaffected by the war.
            German Miners were replaced by Polish coal miners.
            At first the production of the mine increased, but in 1961 the production dropped and in 1962 the mine was abandoned by the government.
            There is no reason for this closure, as the mine was actually productive.
            During the centuries the Zloty Stok mine produced 16 tons of pure gold.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            From the total mine estimated 300 km long on 21 levels, only 30 km are still accessible and surveyed.
            The lower levels are flooded or collapsed.
            The accessible part was used for a show mine, and there is also the possibility to make so-called <i>extreme mine visits</i>.
            Participants are equipped with overall, helmet, lamp and rubber boots and explore passages which are secured but undeveloped.
        </p>
