        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Funtana Chistagna</b> is a name in the local language <b>Vallader</b> which is spoken only in the Unterengadin (Lower Engadine, Engiadina Bassa) and Val Müstair in Kanton Graubünden by some 7,000 people.
            It is a dialect of the Romansh language and is spoken and written, an attempt to switch from Vallader to Rumantsch Grischun as their written language in 2008 failed in 2012 with a referendum and was switched back to Vallader.
            However, it is not a unique language like basque, it is actually a form of Latin, medieval Latin mixed with numerous other languages and modern terms are English or German.
            The reason is simply that those remote valleys in Switzerland were often cut off from the rest of civilization, and even during the best times they left only rarely.
            Vallader is one of five similar dialects and its name is derived from <i>val</i> (valley).
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Funtana Chistagna</b> is actually <i>"funtana chi stagna"</i>, a description which translates <i>"the source that dries up"</i>.
            Quite simple, nevertheless it was used in half a dozen different forms over the centuries.
            «Fontana Chistaina», «Funtana Sistaina», «Fontana Chi staina», «Funtana Chistaina», «Funtana chi staina», and «Funtana Chistagna» in chronological order.
            Today the official name is <b>Funtana Chistagna</b>, sometimes the German translation <b>Stockende Quelle</b> is used.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This is not a tourist site, and actually like most intermittent springs it is impossible to visit.
            Oh, it's possible to get there, although it requires a three-hour hike from the upper Inn river.
            No, the reason why it is impossible to visit the intermittent springs is, that it unfortunately does not dry up anymore, this ended sometime in the early 19th century.
            But as such behaviour was so extraordinary, it was very well documented in literature, though nobody actually spent time to measure ebb and flow for a longer time.
            And as the frequency and amplitude changed with season and weather, there are different, and sometimes contradictory descriptions.
            So if you want to see it yourself, follow road 27 up-valley towards Scuol, there is a turnoff to the left signed "Kieswerk Laurent" and "Raschvella", there is a small parking lot for the hikers.
            Cross the Inn on the covered wooden bridge to the hamlet Raschvella, which actually consists of five houses only, then straight ahead into the Val d'Assa.
            There is no official trail and the biggest obstacle is the 80 m high <b>Assafall</b> waterfall.
            After that it's only walking along the riverbed.
            The distance only about 3.5 km, but it ascends 750 m.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The spring is nevertheless quite interesting.
            It's a narrow fissure in the cliff face from which a small waterfall gushes.
            Right behind the cave entrance is a cave lake and the level of the lake still rises and falls once daily.
            But the times of minimum and maximum differ over the year and the spring does not fall dry anymore.
            It seems the spring water is the melting water of a glacier above and thus with the higher temperature during the day it produces more melting water than during cold nights.
            As there is a lot of snow during winter the best time to visit is between July and October, during the rest of the year it might be covered in snow.
            To enter the cave and see the lake, you should have appropriate equipment.
            While normal mountain trekking gear is sufficient for the walk, we strongly recommend full caving gear including neoprene socks and gum boots.
            There was a number of poles helping with the climb in the 1950s, but they are gone today.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The first examination was made by the Engadine reformer <b class="smallCaps">Duri Champell</b> in 1562, and his experience was published in 1573 in the work <b>Raetiae alpestris topographica descriptio</b> (Topographical Description of Alpine Raetia).
            He notes three cycles per day, the pourings starting at 9, at 12, and in the evening.
            Although <b class="smallCaps">Duri Champell</b>'s visit to the spring provided the first information known today, his main focus was not on the scientific but on the theological utilisation of the experience.
            He was thus part of a philosophical tradition which was popular at the time, it started with <b class="smallCaps">Francesco Petrarch</b>'s ascent of Mont Ventoux in 1336.
            By mentioning the technology of the sundial, his report gives the impression of a precise, scientific description, and at the same time he describes the cave as east-exposed, although it is north-exposed, which he must have known when using a sundial.
        </p>

        <p class="foreign">
            Legend of the last knight at Tschanüff Castle near Ramosch:
            <br>
            Despite a happy marriage, the knight cheated and visited a fairy in the cave of Funtana Chistagna.
            By a trick, his wife found out about the deed, followed the knight into the cave and, while they were both asleep, snatched a lock of the fairy's hair as proof.
            Later, when confronted, the knight promised not to visit the fairy again.
            Since he kept the promise, a curse pronounced by the fairy took effect: the knight died in the war and in the same hour his three sons all died from the plague.
            <br>
            The fairy, however, cried in the morning at the time when she used to expect the knight, and also in the evening when he had left her.
            Her tears were the reason for the pulsating flow of the spring.
