        <h2>History</h2>


        <br class="clear">


        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Ruinaulta</b> is a canyon created by the <b>Hinterrhein</b> (Anterior Rhine) in the debris of the Flims Rockslide.
            It begins near Reichenau where the Hinterrhein meets the <b>Vorderrhein</b> (Posterior Rhine).
            It ends near Ilanz (Glion), a small village which is named Ilanz in German and Glion in Romansh.
            This area of Graubünden (Grisons), which generally belongs to the German speaking part of Switzerland, is inhabited by a Romansh speaking minority.
            Romansh (Romansch, Rumantsch) is a Romance language spoken predominantly in parts of this canton, mostly in rather remote valleys.
            It is one of the descendant languages of the spoken Latin language of the Roman Empire but contains words from Celtic and Raetic, and is strongly influenced by German in vocabulary and morphosyntax.
            The name of this gorge, <b>Ruinaulta</b> or <b>Ruin Aulta</b> is also Romansh and means <i>debris mountain</i>, from ruina (debris slope, quarry) und aulta (high).
            The common German name is <b>Rheinschlucht</b> (Rhine Gorge).
            Sometimes it is dubbed the <b>Grand Canyon der Schweiz</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The enormous mass of debris which fills the former valley more tha 400m deep was created by the <b>Flimser Bergsturz</b> (Flims Rockslide) about 10,000 years ago.
            Between the <b>Flimserstein</b> and the <b>Piz Grisch</b> some 10 Billion cubic meters (10 km³) of rock broke loose and filled the valley between Castrisch and Reichenau severel hundred meters high.
            The Rhine was blocke by this mass and formed a lake, which became 25 kilometers long and filled the upper valley several hundred meters high with water.
            Finally, the water reached the top of the rockslide and a river from the lake started to flow across the debris.
            As the material was not solidified, the water became muddy and transported much of the material in its bed away.
            The river cut into the debris quite fast, much faster than in solid rock.
            And while it cut deeper the lake above became continually lower until it finally vanished.
            Today the gorge has reached tho old ground of the valley, but the formerly wider valley is still full of debris on both sides of the gorge.
            The material is still not solidified, but rainwater has nevertheless started to glue the pieces together with a filling of dissolved and redeposited calcite.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            This gorge is visited by train.
            The train route of the <b>Rhätische Bahn</b> was built through the gorge and there are even train stations at the ground of the gorge.
            Trin, Versam-Safien and Valendas-Sagogn are small villages high up at the mountain side.
            From each a road was built to the ground of gorge, so the inhabitants could reach the train.
            The <b>Rhätische Bahn</b> is a highlight of Switzerland and there are numerous trains with historic cars or panoramic windows.
            During summer there are even special trains with roofless cars.
            The route is quite famous for being a section the <b>Glacier Express</b>.
            It connects Zermatt with the famous pass routes with spectacular tunnels, viaducts, and great views.
            So we strongly recommend booking a ride on this fantastic train and enjoy the gorge relaxed from your seat.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            If you intend to see it by car, you will have difficulties.
            You can use the road, which was built much later, and connects the village high above the gorge.
            The cantonal road 2 to Ilanz offers a few views, but is in general too high.
            You can drive down into the gorge at the train stations, we recommend Versam-Safien.
            There is even a trail 200 m upstream to the huge cliffs around the next corner.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There is also a walking trail on the ground of the gorge, between Reichenau and Trin Station.
            It was built using the train dam, and runs beneath the tracks.
            But unfortunately that's the most harmless part of the gorge, the narrow section starts at Trin.
            But walking on this part of the track is illegal and dangerous.
            Be aware that this is a real railroad connection with numerous train all day.
            The tourist trains are only a small part of the traffic on this connection.
            A trail on this section will not be built the whole gorge is a Natural Monument and protected for its flora and fauna and only a project of national importance would be sufficient for a permit.
            A respective trial was dismissed by the Bundesgericht for this reason.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            But the best way to see the gorge are rafting or kayak tours with one of the local operators.
        </p>
