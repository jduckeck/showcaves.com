        <h2>Geology</h2>

        <p>
            The Cornwall peninsula is mainly a huge <b>crystalline diapir</b>, an intrusion
            of magma which cooled very slowly underground.
            The typical rock of those intrusions is <b>granite</b>, which is chemically
            similar to basalt, but has a really different shape.
            The lava at the surface cools very fast and so all minerals in the lava harden
            to a fine granulated dark rock.
            Magma underground cools very slowly, as the surrounding rock insulates the heat,
            so the result contains big patches of different minerals.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The lava cools slowly down, until the melting point of the highest melting
            mineral is reached.
            Then this mineral becomes hard, forming crystals floating in the hot lava,
            growing bigger and bigger.
            This happens again and again, until only one molten component remains, which
            fills all the gaps.
            Then the whole rock is hard, consisting of minerals and filler.
            This is typically granite, consisting of <b>mica</b>, <b>feldspar</b> and
            <b>quartz</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The interesting process necessary for the Cornish mines, happens when <b>ground
            water</b> reaches the still hot intrusion.
            The rock breaks when it gets contact with the cold water, and the
            <b>fissures</b> allow the ground water to flow through the whole intrusion.
            The water is heated and is able to dissolute numerous ores and minerals, which are
            contained in the granite and the surrounding rock in a very low amount.
            The water transports those substances through the cracks and deposits them
            inside the cracks.
            This are typical ores for Cornwall: tin ores in narrow fissures crossing the
            granite diapir radially.
            From the coast they run towards the center of the peninsula.
        </p>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Geevor Tin Mine</b> is located close to the Cornish coast, the mine with its
            seven floors is rather deep and reaches far out under the sea.
            It was mined until late in the 20th century and so it is a rather modern mine.
            But as the pump engines were stopped when the mine was closed in 1990, the mine
            filled with sea water up to sea level.
            It is today not possible to visit the mine itself, except for a small part of
            the old underground workings close to the surface.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The surface area around the old <b>headframe</b> is very interesting.
            The headframe itself is of impressive size, at its foot is a small building with
            cafe and museum.
            It shows mining tools and historic documents and pictures.
            There are many products on display which were made of the tin from Geevor.
            A 3D model of the mine and a film give an impression of the size of this mine.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Another interesting site is <b>Levant Mine</b>, which is only a few hundred
            meters away.
            This mine was worked during the 19th century and closed in the 1930s.
            Later it was acquired and reopened by the Geevor Mine in the late 1960s and
            mined until both mines closed during the Tin Crisis.
            Today this mine site is managed by a different organization.
            There are no underground tours but a number of interesting mining related
            surface buildings which can be visited, like the old engine house with the
            <b>Levant beam engine</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Other nearby mining sites are the <b>Crowns engine houses</b> of <b>Botallack
            Mine</b>.
            They are located on the cliffs edge, not far away on the coastal path.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Today the <b>Wheal Mexico</b>, a small mine typical of the late 18th and early
            19th centuries, is guided.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Heritage Lottery Fund</b> has approved a GBP 3.8 million bid for
            building restoration and the creation of a major new museum around 2002.
            The project, which was planned to be completed by September 2008, included work
            on the biodiversity of the site.
            The area has become a sort of nature preserve since the mine has closed.
            Once opened by enthusiasts, the site is run by a charity founded by locals in
            2001, the Pendeen Community Heritage.
        </p>
