        <h2>Geology</h2>

        <p>
            Like all other tin mines of Cornwall the mining followed mineralized gangues in the granite diapir.
            The veins are called lode in Cornwall.
            As there is no underground tour there is no geologic aspect at this mine.
        </p>


        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>East Pool Mine</b> is named after its location in the east of Pool, a suburb of Redruth.
            The mine is an open air museum type, there is no underground tour.
            It is nevertheless spectacular as it has quite impressive and well-preserved engines, including one of the largest Cornish pumping engines.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The main sight is probably <b>Michell’s Engine House</b>, which contains the last whim engine built in Cornwall.
            The boiler room contains an exhibition about the daily life of miners in the early 20th century.
            Through the flue tunnel the huge chimney is reached, which is called <b>stack</b> in miner’s terms.
            Standing at the bottom of the stack its possible to see the sky through the chimney.
            A <b>whim</b> is a winding engine which was used to hoist ore and miners from the mine.
            It was named after the local engineer <b class="smallCaps">E. W. Michell</b> who designed it, and was built in 1887.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The second engine at this site is named <b>Taylor’s Engine House</b> and contains a beam engine, which was used for pumping water.
            Taylor’s engine was built in 1892 in the local foundry at Harvey & Co of Hayle.
            It first stood at the Carn Brea Mines, about a kilometer to the south, but was moved here in 1924.
            The massive beam is made of cast iron and weights 52 tons.
            The huge amount of metal in those engines was the reason why most of them were scrapped for metal, when the mines closed and they were not sold to another mine.
            But when East Pool Mine closed it was purchased for preservation by an American engineer-historian.
            He donated it to the Cornish Engines Preservation Society.
            In 1967 the site was given to the National Trust, who manages it until today.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In Cornwall there are two kinds of mines, those which were successful during the 19th century ending with the tin crisis in the 1870, and those which operated during the 20th century until the 1980s.
            There were numerous tin crises, and the mines wer closed now and the due to lack in profitability, some were reopened later. others not.
            East Pool Mine is exceptional as it was successfully operated in the 19th century and again in the 20th century.
            Actually the mine started under the name <b>Pool Old Bal</b> in the early 18th century.
            Bal is the Cornish word for mine and commonly used.
            At this time mainly copper was mined, and it was closed in 1784.
            Reopened under the name <b>East Pool Mine</b> in 1834 it became a tin mine.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The neighbouring mine <b>Wheal Agar</b> was connected underground and so water from this other mine was flowing into East Pool Mine.
            While the other mine was still in operation, there were few problems, but when the mine became unprofitable it was closed in 1895 and the pumps switched off.
            As a result the lower levels of East Pool Mine flooded.
            They had been quite productive, so East Pool Mine purchased Wheal Agar and all its equipment for £4,000 in 1897, with the help of Lord <b class="smallCaps">Robartes</b>, who owned the Wheal Agar land.
            The new mine was called <b>East Pool and Agar</b>, from 1913 <b>East Pool & Agar Limited</b> (EPAL), and was very productive.
            In total 92,000 tons of copper ore and 47,000 tons of tin ore were mined between 1897 and 1921.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The mining at East Pool actually ended with the collapse of the shaft in 1921, after which access to the mine was completely blocked.
            A new shaft was dug between 1922 and 1925 some 250 m from the old one and named <b>Taylor’s Shaft</b>.
            The mine retained the name East Pool and Agar Mine, but its main product was now tungsten, which was in high demand during World War II for the production of weapons.
            At the end of the war this demand ended as well as subsidies and the mine was closed.
            But as nearby South Crofty was still mining, they operated Taylor’s Engine House for the next nine years to keep South Crofty clear.
            In 1954 electric pumps were installed.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The site is a museum and open air site, nevertheless it’s only possible to visit on pre-booked tours.
            Michell’s Engine House is visited self-guided, but again it is necessary to pre-book.
            This site is 400 m to the south, open only Monday to Thursday, and only at two times daily.
            During summer season, between late July and early September the family friendly interactive tour <i>Green Beams and Steam</i> is offered.
            The online booking is mandatory, what makes it a little difficult is that you may book only two weeks in advance.
            The National Trust requires online booking for most sites now, obviously a
            <a target="_top" href="../../../english/explain/Misc/Aftermath.html"><img alt="Explain" class="symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Explain.png">Post-pandemic Aftermath</a>,
            but here it is quite difficult with the two-week restriction.
