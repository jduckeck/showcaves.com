        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Beneath the city centre of Nottingham, the soft <b>Sherwood Sandstone</b>
            allowed the digging of cellars, even with medieval technology.
            So in the last 750 years more than 400 caves where cut out.
            They were used as storerooms, factories, pub cellars (<b>Ye olde Trip to
            Jerusalem</b>), dwelling houses or air raid shelter.
            The city of Nottingham has recently been renamed <b>City of Caves</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Most of the caves are personal property.
            Some of them were destroyed during several centuries of city development.
            But some caves are protected and can be visited as a tourist attraction.
            Still, the so called <b>Caves of Nottingham</b> are not the only possibility to
            see the caves.
        </p>

        <ol>

            <li><b>The Caves of Nottingham</b><br>
                This set of man-made caves was almost lost forever when the modern shopping centre was built.
                Thanks to local voluntary groups, the caves were saved and are now open to visitors.
                Despite the caves, several sights were made up, which makes this place a typical British attraction.
                Attractions included:
                <ul>
                    <li>In <b>Pillar Cave and Tannery</b> the visitor sees Britain's only underground tannery.
                        The room is called pillar cave, because of a characteristic central pillar.
                        It is maybe the oldest cave dating back to 1250.
                        A tannery operated here from AD 1500 to 1640.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Drury Hill</b> was a narrow and winding cobbled street, which was demolished in 1968.
                        This area of the cave shows how it looked like.
                    </li>
                    <li>The <b>Victorian Slum</b> has a connection to the caves, as many of the caves were used as slum dwellings.</li>
                    <li>The <b>Air Raid Shelter</b> shows the youngest history of the caves, as they were used as shelters in World War II.</li>
                    <li><b>Sam Hancock's Caves</b> show how this caves were used as beer cellars for pubs.</li>
                </ul>

                Following the termination of the lease with Caves of Nottingham Ltd, it is
                now under the jurisdiction of the local Gallery of Justice Museum.
                A &pound;50,000 upgrade to the tourist attraction was undertaken in April 2003,
                followed by a grand reopening in May, with full-time interpreters wearing
                costumes representing an archaeologist, air raid warden and tanner.
            </li>


            <li><b>Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem</b><br>
                This pub is called the oldest pub in Britain, as it claims to have been
                established in 1189 AD.
                We do not know if it is really that old, but it is definitely very
                impressive inside, as maybe half of the pub is located inside a cavern.
                But it is not the oldest pub in Britain, this is either the <b>The Old Ferry
                    Boat</b> in St Ives, Cambridgeshire or <b>Ye Olde Fighting Cocks</b> in St
                Albans.
            </li>


            <li><b>Brewhouse Yard: The Museum Of Nottingham Life</b><br>
                This museum is very impressive.
                Many aspects of Nottingham's daily life in the last hundred years are shown.
                The Brewhouse Yard was built at the rocks below the castle and used the caves
                behind to store beer from the brewery.
                Today an Air Raid Shelter exhibition shows many details about World War II.
            </li>


            <li><b>Mortimer's Hole</b><br>
                This is a 100 metres long tunnel between The Trip and the castle.
                It is visited as a part of a castle tour.
                The tunnel is named after <b class="smallCaps">Roger Mortimer</b>, 1st Earl
                of March (25-APR-1287 Wigmore, Herefordshire; 29-NOV-1330 in London).
                After leading a successful rebellion against <b class="smallCaps">Edward
                    II</b>, was for three years de facto ruler of England.
                In 1330, men loyal to <b class="smallCaps">Edward III</b> used this tunnel to
                capture him.
                He was conveyed to the Tower in London, condemned without trial and
                ignominiously hanged at Tyburn.
