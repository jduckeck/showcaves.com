        <h2>Description</h2>

        <div class="foreign">

            <p>
                The underground passages were built from the 14th Century to house the
                pipes that were laid to bring fresh drinking water into Exeter from the
                many natural springs that lie outside the city in the parish of St
                Sidwell's, and to make repairs to the pipes easier to carry out. However
                such a mundane use has not prevented stories of buried treasure, ghosts,
                and secret escape routes.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Exeter's first piped water scheme was organised by the Dean and Chapter
                of Exeter Cathedral, as early as 1226, to supply the clergy with a ready
                supply of clean water from a fountain that was situated on the Cathedral
                Green. A new Cathedral water system was begun in the 1340's to provide
                the Cathedral, St Nicholas Priory and the City, each to have an one third
                share of the supply. The passages constructed at this time form some of
                the passages that can be visited today.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                When the Civil War broke out in 1642, Exeter began preparations in case
                of siege and new defensive ditches were dug to protect the city from the
                army of King Charles I, as Exeter backed Cromwell and Parliament. Some of
                the passages were blocked to prevent an underground invasion and pipework
                was melted down to make lead shot. No water flowed through the system
                until 1655.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                A new water supply was commissioned for the growing population of Exeter
                and work began in 1694 to draw water from the River Exe and pump it to a
                reservoir at the rear of the Guildhall, which continued until 1835.
                Change was brought about by an outbreak of cholera in 1832, which was
                spread by polluted drinking water and largely affected the poorer areas
                of the city. New waterworks were built at Pynes and Danes' Castle.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The underground passages are not suitable for disabled visitors, children
                under five and anybody who suffers from claustrophobia. The floors are
                uneven, the ceilings low and the tunnels are narrow.

            The underworld of Exeter was some time ago called <b>Romangate Passage</b>, as the entrance was located at the Romangate shopping passage.
            It was originaly listed under this name on <span class="mySiteName">showcaves.com</span>.
            Due to the <b>Princesshay development</b>, a mayor reconstruction project in the city center, the tunnels were temporarily closed.
            The entrance moved to the <b>Underground Passages Visitor Centre</b> on Paris Street within the Princesshay Quarter and the site has been renamed <b>Exeter's Underground Passages</b>.
            Like before there is no car park for the tunnels, because of its location in the city centre.
            Please use any of the city centre car parks and walk to the Visitor Center.
            Find a <i>Parking and Shopping Map of Exeter</i> on the official website of the city.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The visitors first pass through an exhibition and a video presentation at the Visitors Center, before they enter the passages on a guided tour.
            There are so-called <i>hands-on activities</i>, which are popular especially with kids.
            New is also a sort of virtual tour through the tunnels, a replica cross-section of Exeter, and an exhibition of archaeological remains found in the passages.
            And finally there is also a new, real size copy of the passages, a sort of replica.
            The new visitor center gives people in wheelchairs or suffering from claustrophobia, who are not able to visit the passages first hand, at least a good impression of them.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The Medieval water system with its underground passages is the only such structure in Great Britain open to the public.
            It was an innovative system when it was constructed.
            It was opened for the public as early as 1933, but at that time the tunnels were not developed.
            Public tours were sort of cave trekking tours, the visitors equipped only with handheld lamps.
            Even helmets were uncommon.
            Today the tunnels are developed, with save paths and electric light, and visitors are provided with helmets for the underground tour.
        </p>
