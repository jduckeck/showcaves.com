        <h2>Description</h2>

        <div class="foreign">

            <p>
                Scott's Grotto is a series of interconnected chambers, extending some 20 m into the chalk hillside.
                The chambers and tunnels are lined with shells, flints and pieces of coloured glass, some donated by friends.
                On top of the hill above the tunnels there is a summer house which would have commanded a wonderful view over the town of Ware.
                The main chamber is called the Council Chamber and this is highly decorated and has seats inset into it's wall.
                One of these seats even has the word FROG written in shells, referring to his wife, Sarah Frogley

            <b>Scott’s Grotto</b> is set within the last remaining part of <b class="smallCaps">John Scott</b>’s Garden, in the south-western corner near the Summerhouse.
            The Scott family were wealthy Quakers.
            <b class="smallCaps">Samuel Scott</b> purchased Amwell House around 1722 and the family moved from Bermondsey to Ware in 1740.
            At that time the estate had some 27 acres.
            <b class="smallCaps">John Scott</b> (*1730-✝1783) was <b class="smallCaps">Samuel</b>’s youngest son and was a commentator on and influencer of political policy, a critic of the Poor Law, and an important figure in the Turnpike movement.
            Today he is mostly known for his poetry.
            He started to landscape the grounds of Amwell House in 1761 to create a formal ‘rococo’ garden.
            This included the construction of several summerhouses, rustic seats, and <i>‘piles of stones’</i>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The grotto was cut into the chalk hillside.
            There were legends that it cost GBP 10,000 and took 30 years to complete, but it was actually completed in 1764.
            At first there were only the porch and the underground chamber immediately behind it.
            <b class="smallCaps">Scott</b> called it his <b>Shell Temple</b>.
            The other underground rooms were completed in 1773 and visited by Dr. <b class="smallCaps">Samuel Johnson</b>, a friend of <b class="smallCaps">Scott</b>.
            He called it <i>A Fairy Hall</i>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The shell house and grotto was most likely inspired by the grotto of <b class="smallCaps">Alexander Pope</b> at Twickenham.
            But actually it is unclear why he built a grotto, as a garden feature, as a way of attracting his friends from London, or to give his workers employment during the winter months.
            He was a Quaker, so this kind of social engagement is conceivable.
            <b class="smallCaps">Scott</b> was a poet and wrote his best known poem <b>Amwell</b> in the octagonal summerhouse above the grotto.
            Originally the poem was known as <i>A Prospect of Ware and the Country Adjacent</i>.
            <b class="smallCaps">John Scott</b> inherited the site in 1768.
            In 1783 <b class="smallCaps">John Scott</b>'s daughter, <b class="smallCaps">Maria Scott</b>, inherited the estate.
            After her death the property was sold and Scotts Road was built, which actually destroyed the garden.
            In the mid 1960s the present modern houses were built and the entrance of the cave demolished.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Only ten years later the value of the site was finally recognized and the East Hertfordshire District Council acquired the land and carried out basic repairs on the grotto.
            The <b>Ware Society</b>, a local voluntary group, opened the grotto to the public in 1983.
            Around 1990 the grotto and the octagonal Summerhouse above were renovated, completed in 1991.
            The site is today operated by a non-profit organisation named <b>Scott's Grotto CIO</b>, the custodian which is still given on older webpages seems to be retired.
