        <p>
            The famous <b>White Cliffs of Dover</b> are not the only cretaceous cliffs on
            the south coast of England.
            But they are definitely the most famous ones!
            Dover is the closest point to France, it is only 27km across the Channel.
            The closeness to the continent was one reason to start the first tunnel from
            here, several hundred years ago, but it was never completed.
            Todays <b>Chunnel</b> starts at nearly the same place.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Castle of Dover</b> is located on the highest point above the cliff.
            Already during the Middle Ages, the cliffs were used to build fortifications.
            That is rather easy because of the softness of the cretaceous chalk.
            It is possible to dig tunnels using a pick or an axe and a shovel.
            But the history is much older: more than two thousand years of settlement in the
            area, almost without break from the Iron Age until today.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The construction of the huge caverns started in 1797.
            Napoleonic engineers needed to house large numbers of soldiers, but they were
            not able to build enough barracks, because they ran out of ground.
            So they decided to go underground, building seven parallel brick vaults linked
            by a tunnel to the rear.
            At the rear end the vaults are 18m underground, at the front end a balcony
            offers a view over Dover Harbour.
            The so-called <b>Casements</b> were first occupied in 1803 and held 2,000
            soldiers.
        </p>

        </figure>


        <p>
            During World War II the old tunnels were reused.
            Vice-Admiral <b class="smallCaps">Bertram Home Ramsey</b> took command of
            Channel defences in 1939 and developed the Casements as a headquarter.
            It was easy to widen them and to build any kind of bunker needed.
            Then the balcony was overlooking the Channel, against the enemy.
            It was usefull as an lookout, but also as an ideal place for radar and radio
            stations.
            The bunker system was named <b>Hellfire Corner</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Hellfire Corner was used as a control centre for the World War II operation
            <b>"Dynamo"</b> in 1940.
            In this operation the British evacuated 338,000 soldiers from Dunkirk.
            The troops were already enclosed by German tanks, but they were rescued using
            anything available, which was able to float: battle ships or simple sailing
            boats.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The war continued, under Ramsey's command, the Casements became crowded with
            offices and communications equipment.
            He expanded the tunnels in two sections:

        <ul>
            <li>A set of new tunnels above the Casement tunnels, called <b>the Annexe</b> was designed as a hospital.</li>
            <li>A lower level, called <b>Dumpy</b>, to serve as additional administrative space.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            During the Cold War, in the 1960s, the caverns were reused as a nuclear command
            centre.
            They converted them into a regional seat of post war government.
            The intensive modernization included new air filtration, power generation, and
            communications equipment.
            The existence of these tunnels remained a military secret until 1984, when the
            underground installation was decommissioned by the army and turned over to the
            English Heritage.
            They left hospital equipment from World War II, original telephone exchange
            equipment from the 1930s and 1940s, and equipment from Ramsey's operations
            rooms.
            Some tunnels from this period are still not open to the public.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tour shows the Secret Operations Room and the Communications Room with its
            large quantities of old switchboards, amplifiers and other equipment.
            The Hospital is visited and the Napoleonic Casements.
            The vault that contained Admiral Ramsey's office has been cleared but left
            unrestored to give an impression of the size of the Napoleonic barracks.
