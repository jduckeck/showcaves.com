        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Legend tells, <b>St Fillan's Cave</b> was the cell of the 7th century saint, <b
                class="smallCaps">St Fillan</b>.
            It also tells, that he wrote his sermons in the complete darkness of the cave
            while his arm emitted a luminous glow to enable him to see.
            <b class="smallCaps">St Fillan</b> was an early Christian missionary from
            Ireland, and his bell and crozier are still preserved in the <b>Royal Museum of
            Scotland</b> in Edinburgh.
            The <b>Abbot of Inchaffray</b> carried relics of <b class="smallCaps">St
            Fillan</b> into the <b>Battle of Bannockburn</b>.
            That is the reason why the Scots attributed their victory to the support of <b
                class="smallCaps">St Fillan</b>.
            Many miracles of healing were attributed to the saint and to <b>Holy Wells</b>
            associated with him.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The common belief that <b class="smallCaps">St Fillan</b> was a hermit who lived
            in this cave permanently is unlikely to be true.
            Like many of his fellow missionaries he most likely has led a peripatetic life,
            moved from one small community to another, and stayed wherever there was
            shelter.
            He most likely used the cave, as it is an ideal cover for an occasional
            stopover.
            But the cave is too damp and cool to live here for a longer period.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave gave the village <b>Pittenweem</b> its name: it is Pictish, <i>pit</i>
            meaning place and <i>weem</i> meaning a cave, so Pittenweem means <b>Place of
            the Cave</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>St Fillan's Cave</b> is a natural sea cave, formed by the waves in a soft
            yellow sandstone.
            There are some speleothems in the rear of the cave which suggests that there is
            some lime in the surrounding rock.
            In the 7th century, when <b class="smallCaps">St Fillan</b> arrived here, the
            cave was only accessible by boat.
            The harbour as it is today, was built much later.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Today an iron gate in the sandstone cliff protects the cavern.
            Behind the gate, the path goes down a steep slope to the inner part of the cave.
            The cave is shaped like a Y.
            The left passage leads to the small well, said to be one of the <b>Holy
            Wells</b> of <b class="smallCaps">St Fillan</b>.
            This part of the cave seems to be mostly in its natural state.
            The right passage leads to a heavyly altered chamber with an altar, which is
            used as a church.
            Steps in the rock lead to the underground passage to the <b>Prior of Pittenweem
            gardens</b> above the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In the 12th century Augustinian monks built a monastery on the hill above the
            cave.
            They included the cave into their monastery, most likely they secured the
            entrance and then made the passage to the Priory garden above.
            Probably they used the cave as storage room, the goods arrived at the harbour
            and were brought into the cave.
            The cool cave was a natural refrigerator for food, and the staircase allowed
            them to get what they needed without leaving their grounds.
            The cave was maintained by the monks until the Reformation.
            In the following years the caves were used for several profane purposes.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            In the 18th century the cave was used by smugglers, but once Excise men
            confiscated the goods in the cave.
            They took the goods to a house in Marygate.
            The smugglers tried to regain their goods, entered the house and attacked the
            Excise men.
            But they were arrested, tried and sentenced to death.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Many local people were upset at the unjust severity of the punishment.
            So they accompanied the transport to Edinburgh for execution.
            Before the execution, the crowd became restive and the officer in charge
            panicked and ordered his soldiers to fire on the crowd.
            The following riots, commemorated in the Grass Market in Edinburgh, are known as
            the <b>Porteous riots</b>, after the hapless officer who ordered the shooting.
            The condemned men escaped during the riots.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Later the cave was used as a rubbish dump, but in 1935 the Rector <b
                class="smallCaps">Canon de Voil</b> and his father dug out the rubbish and built
            a shrine in the cave.
            The altar was consecrated by the Bishop of St Andrews.
            Since then the cave is used for occasional religious services by nearby <b>St
            John's Episcopal Church</b> and other pilgrimages from all over Scotland.
            Every year on Holy Saturday night an ecumenical Easter service takes place, to
            commemorate the burial of Christ in a similar rock-hewn sepulchre in Jerusalem.
            The cave is owned by the Bishop Lowe Trust and is entrusted to St John's
            Scottish Episcopal Church in Pittenweem
        </p>
