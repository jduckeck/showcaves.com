        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Humphrey Kynaston’s Cave</b> is a small sandstone cave in a soft red sandstone which was formerly used as a cave dwelling.
            It seems the cliff face is the result of a long ago abandoned sandstone quarry, and the cave may be, at least partially, the remains of the quarrying.
            The entrance is about six meters up the cliff face with a staircase leading up to it, cut into the soft rocks.
            Long time usage abraded the steps and made them difficult to use, so a wooden staircase to the cave entrance was built.
            However, this wooden staircase laste much shorter than the stone stairs and has been removed some time ago.
            As the stone staircase is a little dangerous, a well-meaning person has taken the trouble to close it off with a wooden fence.
            So it is no longer possible to reach the cave entrance unless you simply climb around the fence, which of course none of our readers would think of doing.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave has two chambers being about four square meters big, the one on the right being a little bigger than the left one.
            The cave is closed off by bars on the entrance, which protects the cave and still allows to see the whole cave.
            It is a good idea to take a torch with you to look inside the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is named after <b class="smallCaps">Humphrey Kynaston</b> (*1474-✝1534), a robber and enchanter, who was a sort of <i>Shropshire Robin Hood</i> or <b class="smallCaps">Rob Roy</b>.
            He was seemed guilty of murder, together with two others, and was declared an outlaw by King <b class="smallCaps">Henry VII</b> in 1491.
            He had to take shelter in a cave in the west point of Nesscliffe Rock.
            He lived in one room and stabled his horse in the other, closing the entrance with an iron door which, according to legend, became the door of Shrewsbury gaol.
            Only two years later he was pardoned by King <b class="smallCaps">Henry VII</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There is an engraving in the cave, in the strong pillar dividing it into two rooms, which reads <b>H K 1564</b>.
            If one looks closely enough, the initials and the date can still be seen.
            This is by some interpreted that he built the cave himself in the year 1564, which actually does not fit with documents from that time.
            More likely is though that his grandson, <b class="smallCaps">Humfridus Kynaston</b> (born 1530) visited the cave 30 years after his death and left his signature.
            The story was retold in the book <b>Old Stories</b>, Volume 1, by <b class="smallCaps">Elizabeth Isabella Spence</b> from 1822.
            This is definitely a reason why it is well known to the locals.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is located on the southwestern side of Nesscliffe Hill.
            The forested hill is a popular destination for walks dubbed <b>Nesscliffe Hill Country Park</b>.
            It is freely accessible and the trails to the cave are signposted.
            The entrance is at the main road through Nesscliffe, opposite The Old Three Pigeons pub.
            Its a 300 m 10 minutes hike slightly uphill.

        <div class="foreign">

            <p>
                During an excursion into Shropshire and North Wales, in the summer of 1820, the extraordinary natural curiosity of Kynaston’s Cave was pointed out to me, as one of those singular and wild spots which is visited by every traveller who goes in quest of romantic scenery and legendary lore, with which not only North Wales, but every part of Shropshire abounds.
                The tradition which belongs to this Cave suggested the idea of forming a tale on the subject; but the remote period in which the events occurred that marked the life of Sir Humphry Kynaston, the author hopes will plead her excuse for an imperfect sketch formed on the slender materials obligingly supplied by Mr. Dovaston of West Felton, finding it impossible to trace from any authority the characters and names of Sir Humphry’s associates.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                This I found to be Ness Cliff; the famous spot within whose cold bosom dwelt the out-law, Sir Humphrey Kynaston.
                The situation of Ness Cliff is extremely romantic; and commands from its most elevated point a vast extent of country, wildly diversified by the towering mountains of Montgomeryshire, whose spiral summits often veil themselves in the clouds.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                On reaching the part of the rock which was marked by no particular projection, but appeared to be one even mass of stone, the retreat of the robber was discerned by a high flight of stone steps, half broken and worn away, which led to a door, made of late years by the solitary inhabitant; for in former ages the entrance into the cave was through an aperture, sufficient only to admit Kynaston and his faithful horse.
                A hole, containing a pane of glass, answered the purpose of a window; throwing sufficient light within to show the dreariness of this extraordinary human habitation.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                We immediately gained admittance within.
                Here the appearance of romance was at an end.
                The old woman who showed the cave, by no means identified the haggard witch, weird sister, we looked for in a place so lonely and so wild.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The old woman was dressed in the plain homely garb of her country; and spoke to us with the natural civility of a person, who expects to be rewarded for their trouble.
                She was, however, ready and apt in the history of Sir Humphrey Kynaston, which she had related, probably, a thousand times.
                She presented us with a small ballad, which is told with pleasing simplicity and truth, by Mr. Dovaston, of Westfelton.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                I examined the cave with much interest and attention.
                It is of a circular form, from fifteen to twenty feet in dimensions.
                This rugged and unshapen mass of solid rock, most curiously so recedes within, as to form a cavity, sufficient to contain in the upper and lower compartment, the beds of the old woman and her son: originally the nightly shelter, and place of repose, for Kynaston and his horse.
                Here he lived, and here he expired, as the wall bears date, in the year 1564.
                The present inhabitants of this savage dwelling have supplied themselves, not only with every necessary piece of furniture, but also with the means of subsistence.
                The young man, by occupation a cobbler, was seated in the midst of his tools and straps, busily at work; singing as he went on, for "want of thought."
