        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Humphrey Kynaston's Cave</b> is a small sandstone cave in a soft red sandstone which was formerly used as a cave dwelling.
            It seems the cliff face is the result of a long ago abandoned sandstone quarry, and the cave may be, at least partially, the remains of the quarrying.
            The entrance is about six meters up the cliff face with a staircase leading up to it, cut into the soft rocks.
            Long time usage abraded the steps and made them difficult to use.
            So a wooden staircase to the cave entrance was built.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave has two chambers being about four square meters big, the one on the right being a little bigger than the left one.
            The cave is closed by bars on the entrance, which is not a problem, as it protects the cave and still allows to see the whole cave.
            It is a good idea to bring an electric torch to look inside.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is named after <b class="smallCaps">Humphrey Kynaston</b> (*1474-✝1534), a robber and enchanter, who was a sort of <i>Shropshire Robin Hood</i> or <b class="smallCaps">Rob Roy</b>.
            He was seemed guilty of murder, together with two others, and was declared an outlaw by King <b class="smallCaps">Henry VII</b> in 1491.
            He had to take shelter in a cave in the west point of Nesscliffe Rock.
            He lived in one room and stabled his horse in the other, closing the entrance with an iron door which, according to legend, became the door of Shrewsbury gaol.
            Only two years later he was pardoned by King <b class="smallCaps">Henry VII</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            There is an engraving in the cave, in the strong pillar dividing it into two rooms, which reads <b>H K 1564</b>.
            If one looks closely enough, the initials and the date can still be seen.
            This is interpreted that he built the cave himself in the year 1564, which actually does not fit with documents from that time.
            It seems there are different versions of the story.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            One version of the story was one of two parts in the book <b>Old Stories</b>, by <b class="smallCaps">Elizabeth Isabella Spence</b> from 1822.
            This is definitely a reason, why it is well known to the locals.

                The interest of the tale of Sir <b class="smallCaps">Humphrey Kynaston</b>, turns on the person of his wife, <b class="smallCaps">Isabel Griffith</b>, a beautiful girl, the daughter of a farmer, to whom he had been united before the course of dissipation, which, by degrees, led him to a life terminating in his outlawry.
                On this he retires with his horse to the cave, known by the name of <b>Kynaston's Cave</b>, and there he resides till seized by fatal illness.
                To attend and endeavour to relieve him from his malady, a woman famed for her skill in simples, is here introduced to him, and proves to be Isabel his wife, whose love for him had survived all his ill-treatment, and in whose arms he dies.

                The scenes ... are laid in Shropshire, at <b>Kynaston's Cave</b>, the present abode of an old woman, who shews it as a curiosity to the traveller, and formerly the resort of a famous outlaw, called <b>Sir</b> <b class="smallCaps">Humphrey Kynaston</b>, a sort of <b class="smallCaps">Rob Roy</b>, whose exploits were matter of much sensation and alarm when he lived, about the year 1564.
