        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Banwell's Bone Caves</b> were once more visited than nearby Cheddar Caves,
            which are now the famous show caves of the area.
            The caves are located on private property on the western end of Banwell hill, a
            property once owned by Dr <b class="smallCaps">George Henry Law</b>, Lord
            Bishop of Bath and Wells, and lord of the manor of Banwell.
            He and the then vicar of Banwell, Dr <b class="smallCaps">Randolph</b>, needed
            funds for a charity school which had just been opened in Banwell, and they had
            the idea to use the fees of guided tours into the cave for this purpose.
            Bishop <b class="smallCaps">Law</b> developed the site, near the entrance to the
            caves he erected some stones similar to a druidical circle and he laid out the
            park.
            The cottage, built in 1827, was used to accommodate distinguished guests.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The farmer <b class="smallCaps">William Beard</b> from Banwell was self-educated
            and had read about the discovery of prehistoric animals' remains in various
            parts of Great Britain.
            It was the era of Professor <b class="smallCaps">Buckland</b> from Oxford, who
            talked about the bones of extinct animals which were used to explore the story
            of life on Earth.
            At this time, the general theory about bones in caves was that they were of
            diluvial origin, meaning they were the result of the flood descrobed in the
            Bible.
            <b class="smallCaps">Buckland</b> now had the idea that the bones could be the
            result of natural processes and tell us about the situation many thousand years
            ago.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At that time the area was mined for lead on various locations.
            <b class="smallCaps">William Beard</b> had heard lead-miners talking of a huge
            cavern they had struck on Banwell hill, and guessed it could be of importance.
            <b class="smallCaps">John Webb</b>, an old miner, showed him the spot where the
            shaft had been sunk many years before.
            <b class="smallCaps">William Beard</b> and the miner <b
                class="smallCaps">Colman</b> removed some 35m of debris and discovered a natural
            cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The newly discovered cave was a huge chamber, 35m long, 10m high and 20m wide.
            It contained fine speleothems, stalactites and stalagmites, with a floor of huge
            rocks covered by stalagmites, which was called <b>Stalactite Cave</b>.
            The Bishop and the vicar, planning a show cave, saw the need of an easier
            access.
            A fissure lower down the hill, which ran in the direction of the cave, was
            explored.
            After some excavations the fissure widened and opened into another cave.
            This one was even more extraordinary than the first one: it contained bones, the
            reason why <b class="smallCaps">William Beard</b> originally started his search.
            The floor was covered by more than a metre of bones of prehistoric animals, so
            the cave was named <b>Banwell Bone Cave</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The discovery became a national sensation, mainly because of the skull of a
            great cave lion, which was said to be the best specimen ever found in Britain.
            As typical for the era the bones were sorted and stacked neatly against the wall
            of the cave.
            The finest specimens were removed by <b class="smallCaps">Beard</b> who became
            the official guide.
            He received the parties when they arrived, guided them through Bone Cavern
            explaining how the discovery was made.
            Then he proceeded to the Stalactite Cavern which was reached down a crude flight
            of steps.
            Highlight was a huge stalagmite known as <i>The Bishop's Chair</i>, which
            resembled the ancient stone crowning chair at Winchester Cathedral.
            Returning from the cave the parties rested at the summer house, then walked
            across the hill to Winthill, to the cottage of <b class="smallCaps">Beard</b>.
            Here he had collections of speleothems and bones.
            The massive cabinets also contained bones from the Hutton, Sandford and Uphill
            caves, which Beard had also explored.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            After the discovery of the caves, Beard read every line available about
            palaeontology.
            He became remarkably informed and so after some time the Bishop started to call
            him Professor.
            This title sticked, although Beard never visited university.
            Beard became almost a national personality, obviously because he guided many
            distinguished visitors into the caves.
        </p>
