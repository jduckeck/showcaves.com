        <h1 align="center">Smoo Cave</h1>
        <h2 align="center">by Tony Oldham</h2>

        <br clear="all">

        <h2>History</h2>

        <p>
            The name "Smoo" is thought to be derived from the Norse word "smjugg"
            meaning a hole. In 1992 an archaeological dig on a midden site inside
            the cave unearthed many interesting finds. The upper layers were Iron
            Age in origin making this one of the most northerly habitation sites in
            the British mainland. The midden was packed with shells, some of which
            can still be seen today poking through the top soil. Deeper levels were
            progressively older and the deposits at the base are thought to belong to
            the Mesolithic Period, when the earliest human inhabitants arrived in the
            Highlands. Much earlier in 1904 an organised excavation took place but a
            report was never published.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Among the many local legends surrounding the cave is that of the feared
            highway man <b class="smallCaps">McMurdo</b>. Legend has it that during the sixteen century,
            <b class="smallCaps">McMurdo</b> murdered his victims by thowing them down the blowhole into the
            cave. You can still see McMurdo's tomb at Balnakeil Church which
            overlooks nearby Balnakeil Bay.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            By far the most colourful tales of Smoo are those told about the
            first Lord Reay, Master of MacKay, <b class="smallCaps">Donald of MacKay</b>, known as the Wizard
            of Reay. It is said that in former times there was an iron ring in the
            wall of Geo Smoo where Reay used to chain his transgressors, who were left
            to drown at high tide. Whilst exploring the further reaches of the cave
            Reay came across a small wooden cask. He pulled out the plug and out
            crawled a tiny man 5cm in height. The man quickly grew into a giant and
            turned out to be the devil who cried out "Well now Donald, what are you
            going to do now". Donald quickly regained his senses and suggested to
            the devil that if he really wanted to impress him he should resort to his
            original size. The devil obliged and Donald quickly stuffed him back in
            the cask and replaced the plug. I hope that any cavers exploring the
            inner reaches of Smoo Cave will take note.

        <p class="indentedText">
            Any cave located on or near the coast is a natural warehouse for "duty
            free" goods. Smoo Cave is ideally situated as it has access from the sea
            via a long and narrow sea loch called Geo Smoo, where high cliffs provide
            shelter even in the roughest of weather.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave has been the scene of many historical visitations, see list of
            references, but the best account is by Sir <b class="smallCaps">Walter Scott</b>, after a visit in
            1814

        <h2>Geology</h2>

        <p>
            The cave is formed in a band of Durness limestone which in turn is
            surrounded by quartzite, gneiss and grits. Originally a small swallet
            cave, the entrance has been much enlarged by the action of the sea.
        </p>

        <br clear="all">


        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            A steep footpath leads down to the vast entrance 33 m wide and 16 m high.
            The floor of the main chamber is barely a metre above normal high tide mark, and is
            covered with sand and boulders. On the right of this chamber a small
            stream enters. This is the Allt Smoo,
            which sinks down a 21 m pothole, which may be seen on the other side of
            the road from the footpath. In 1986 the cave was modernised and the
            footpaths improved. It is now possible to do a round trip, down one
            flight of steps and go back up to the road via another pathway. This
            gives an excellent view of the karstfenster. Another improvement has
            been the addition of a covered bridge which was placed across the first
            lake. Although the tour is self guided, in August a local entrepreneur
            provides a boat tour across the third lake. This leads to 16 m of low
            wet passage. At the same time, lights were installed in the cave. The
            lights are on all the time and have produced a fine display of
            lampenflora.
