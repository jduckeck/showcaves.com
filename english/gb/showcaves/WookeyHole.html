            <b>Wookey Hole</b> is a river cave located at the small village of the same name
            near Wells.
            The cave is the source of the river <b>Axe</b>, both the cave and the spring is
            used by man since prehistoric times.
            The river was later used by a mill, then by a paper mill.
            The parking lot is located at one end of the village, to reach the cave it must
            be crossed by foot, about 10 minutes walk.
            The first part of the village is full of shops, kiosks, and fish and chips.
            Then at the paper mill, the Wookey Hole theme park starts.
            The cave tour is only one of numerous "rides" of this theme park, which also
            offers, Dinosaur Valley, King Kong, Wizards Play Barn, Toddlers Play Area, Fairy
            Garden, Handmade Paper, Magical Mirror Maze, Penny Arcade, Clown Museum, Pirate
            Play Area, and Wookey Circus.
            We do not review theme parks, so we will only comment on the cave and history
            related parts of the park.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The entrance to the <b>Wookey Hole</b> cave is on the right side of the valley,
            which means it is at the end of a gorge cut into the limestone by the river Axe.
            The trail from the paper mill to the cave entrance is in the middle of the
            park-like valley floor.
            The cave is entered through a dry section, the first three chambers show no sign
            of a cave river any more.
            It flows through younger passages right below, at least most of the time.
            When the water level raises after very heavy rains, this part might be flooded.
            However, river Axe is visble in chaber 1 and 3, but from chamber 1 it flows through two sumps to the resurgence.
            Chamber three or <b>Witch's Parlour</b> is famous for its size, a huge solution
            dome dissolved by the ground water when the ground water level was much higher.
            In comparison to its rather low ceiling, the room has an extreme diameter.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The following chambers are totally different, high and narrow clefts.
            Starting from chamber three, artificial tunnels connect them.
            The natural connection of the chambers lies below and is filled completely with
            water, only accessible for cave divers.
            The last chamber is chamber 9, which is called <b>Cathedral</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The developed trail ended at <b>chamber nine</b> or <b>Cathedral Cave</b> for many years.
            From chamber 9 another artificial tunnel leads back to the surface near the
            resurgence of the Axe.
            In 2015 the tour was extended by the construction of 74m long tunnel from chamber 9 to the chamber 20.
            This is a dead end, so it is necessary to return to chamber 9 to leave the cave.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Today Wookey Hole is explored to chamber 25, called the <b>Lake of Gloom</b>.
            Until this point the cave is almost horizontal, going up and down, so the cave is partly water-filled and partly air-filled.
            But at the end of this chamber, the character of the cave changes.
            It starts to steadily go down.
            The sump is closed by gravel chokes after about 400m and 90m below water level.
            This is the deepest point of the cave, and as the water level of cave river is around 64m a.s.l., this spot is about 26m below sea level.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Wookey Hole lies in the same limestone ridge as the famous
        <li><a href="Cheddar.html"><img class="ui-li-icon ui-corner-none symbol" src="../../../graphics/symbol/Showcave.png" alt="Showcave"><b>Cheddar gorge</b></a></li>
        ,
        only a few kilometers to the south.
        The limestone is covered by a layer of dolomitic breccia, which is less prone
        to solution.
        There are less cracks and the chemistry of dolomite is different to limestone
        which also makes it a little less soluble.
        This difference explans many details of the cave formation.
        </p>

            The cave exit is on the left side of the valley, close to the spring of the river
            Axe below a steep limestone cliff face.
            The way back is following the tree-lined canal path, a trail along the paper mill
            canal which was build in 1857.
            The water was dammed for the canal, and so the water level inside the cave
            raised and chambers 4 and 5 were flooded.
            The canal is two meters deep and flowing steadily, a huge amount of water
            sufficient to drive the machinery of a paper mill.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Along the trail are three small rock shelters, named <b>Hyena Den</b>, <b>Badger
            Hole</b> and <b>Rhinoceros Hole</b>.
            When the canal was dug, the workmen cut through the <b>Hyena Den</b> and its
            30cm thick sediments.
            The bones in the sediments were from rhinoceros, bear, mammoth and lion, animals
            of both warmer and colder epochs.
            There were also some flint tools, archaeologists believe that the cave was used
            by hyenas and man alternatively from 35,000 to 25,000 BC.
            Both used the cave for hunting, driving their prey over the cliff edge and then
            harvest the remains.
            Similar remains were later excavated from <b>Badger Hole</b> and <b>Rhinoceros
            Hole</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The <b>Cave Museum</b> is dedicated to the local geology and the history of cave
            diving.
            It is located in a building of the former paper mill.
            Numerous items, like old diving suits and caving lamps are of great interest.
            The concentration on cave diving is obviously because the first cave diving
            expedition of history happened 1935 at Wookey Hole.
            <b class="smallCaps">Penelope Powell</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Graham
            Balcombe</b> discovered chamber four to seven.
            And the most exciting fact was, that the first cave diver was a woman!
            Later, in 1948, they made two more expeditions, using diving gear developed
            through World War II.
            First they discovered chamber 8 and 9 and then chamber 10 and 11.
            <b class="smallCaps">Robert Parker</b> made the so far deepest dive in 1985
            arriving a depth of 68m.
            In September 2004 <b class="smallCaps">John Volanthen</b> and <b
                class="smallCaps">Rick Stanton</b> reached a depth of over 76m setting a new
            record.
