        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            The rock of Gibraltar is honeycombed by natural caves as well as tunnels.
            Some 150 principal and natural caves have been distinguished to date situated
            above present day sea-level
            and more are known to exist below.
            <b>St Michael's Caves</b> consists of two caves:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>Old St. Michael's Cave</b> is known since roman times.</li>
            <li><b>New St. Michael's Cave</b> was discoverd in 1942 when a tunnel was being driven into the largest chamber of the Old St Michael's Cave.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Old St. Michael's Cave</b> - or <b>Cathedral Cave</b> - was long believed to
            be bottomless.
            Maybe this is the origin of the story that Gibraltar was linked to Africa by a
            subterranean passage - more than 24 km long -
            under the <b>Straits of Gibraltar</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            <b>Old St. Michael's Cave</b> consists of an <b>Upper Hall</b> with 5 connecting
            passages to a smaller hall.
            The largest chamber of Old St Michael's Cave is large enough to serve as a
            concert hall.
            It makes a unique auditorium for concerts, ballets, drama and presentations.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            During World War II the <b>Upper Hall</b> was prepared as an emergency hospital,
            but was never used as such.
            In 1942 a tunnel was build to provide reasonable air ventilation, which cut into
            <b>New St Michael's Cave</b>.
            In this time kilometers of tunnels and chambers were dug out of the limestone
            and an <b>underground city</b>, with its
            own electricity supply, telephone exchanges, frozen meat stores, water
            distillers, bakery and hospitals was built.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            At the far end of the Chamber an old stalagmite became too heavy and fell on its
            side.
            In 1972 a slice 45 cm thick was cut, revealing its interior structure.
            Its growth is clearly indicated during periods of excessive rain by light brown
            rings and during periods of less rain by dark brown rings.
            Two thin lines of a crumbly white substance are thought to represent <b>glacial
            periods</b>.
            The stalagmite is also translucent in some areas.
        <p>

        <p>
            <b>New St. Michael's Cave</b>, also called <b>Lower St Michael's Cave</b>, has a
            lake some 30 meters long and up to
            11 meters wide and 6 meters deep.
            One of its remarkable features are the <b>calcite ledges</b> formed at the lake
            margin by deposition from the surface of
            calcium bicarbonate-saturated water.
            Access into this cave system tends to be hazardous and can only be visited with
            the assistance of a guide.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Until recently the caves were controlled and looked after by the <b>Royal
            Engineers</b>.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Many prehistoric relics have been found in Gibraltar caves, including the first
            Neanderthal-type skull.
        </p>

        Description: The Upper Rock Nature Reserve  is a protected area of great natural beauty perched about
        1380ft (421m) above sea level on the limestone peninsular of Gibraltar.
        Its most famous residents are the Barbary Apes, which have lived on the Rock for hundreds of years
        as Europe's only free-roaming monkeys.
        According to legend, when the apes leave, Gibraltar will cease to be British.
        The Reserve is also home to many species of bird, such as buzzards and Barbary partridges, and
        plantlife, including honeysuckle, jasmine and Gibraltar Sea Lavender.

        Visitors also come to see St Michael's Cave, one of a vast warren of caves containing stalagmites
        and stalactites, and the Siege Tunnels, which were used as a defence system by the British in the Great Siege (1779-1783) against the French and Spanish.
        The Military Heritage Centre displays weapons used by the British Army in Gibraltar and houses a
        Memorial Chamber of remembrance to those who served in the Armed Forces.
        Another popular site in the Reserve is the 14th-century Moorish Castle, which testifies to the
        diverse history of the peninsular.
