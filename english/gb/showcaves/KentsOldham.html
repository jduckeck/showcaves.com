            <p>
                Although today one is unlikely to see any animal life in Kents Cavern, except
                the occasional bat, there was a time when it went through a long period of
                habitation, both by man and by animals.
                Since 1828 Kents Cavern has been the subject of many archaeological excavations
                and the research workers have found many items of interest.
                Flint implements found indicated that they must have been made and used by man
                at least 100,000 years ago.
                They also found the fireplace where primitive man cooked his meals and the bones
                of many animals, now extinct, which he used to eat.
                The implements include harpoons, awls, combs and brooches.
                Animal remains include those of rhinoceros, wolf, cave lion, hyena, cave bear,
                baby mammoth and Irish elk.
                These can be seen both at the small museum at the cave and at the Torquay
                Natural History Society Museum at Wellswood, Torquay.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Ancient cave man would hardly recognise his former home today.
                The tour of the cave is a circular one, and throughout it is possible to see the
                original floor level high above, the section below having been excavated for
                archaeological remains.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Kents Cavern is profusely decorated with stalagmites and stalactites of every
                colour and hue, which are shown to great advantage in the electric lights, which
                are carefully placed in order that they should not be obtrusive.
                Some of the best formations are to be found in the Organ Chamber.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                One of the most famous formations in the cave is that known as the Lion.
                On the head of the Lion is the inscription Robert Hedges of Ireland, Feb. 20
                1688.
                By calculating the amount of stalagmite which has filled in the inscription
                since it was carved out, it is possible to estimate the length of time it takes
                the stalagmite to grow.
                So although Mr Hedges was possibly the first of the cave vandals, he
                unconsciously provided a valuable source of reference to those who came after.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                On the way round the cave the guide points out the various places where
                archaeological finds of note were made, including the remains of a cave bear's
                skull, which is still embedded in the roof.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Apart from being a very pleasant trip, this tour is both educational and
                informative.
