            The following text was provided by Frederick Gomez and the

        <br clear="all">


        <p>
            The caves have been explored over the years, and numerous fossil remains
            found, including the skull of a Neanderthal Woman. This was discovered in
            1848 in Forbes Quarry, at the foot of the North Face of the Rock, before the
            famous discovery of the Neanderthal Valley. Its discovery was not
            publicised and the skull lay forgotten in a cupboard in the Garrison Library
            for many years. Had its importance been recognised at the time, we might
            well talk today about Gibraltar Woman instead of Neanderthal Woman.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            A fine display of prehistoric tools, implements and fossil remains found in
            various caves on the Rock can be seen in The Gibraltar Museum, situated at
            Bomb House Lane. Fossil remains include bones of elephants, rhinoceros,
            deer, wild horses, hyenas, leopards and African lynx.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The following is a report prepared by Frederick Gomez from The Gibraltar
            Cave Exploration and Protection Group.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Gibraltar is honeycombed by natural caves as well as tunnels, some 150
            principal and natural caves have been distinguished to date situated above
            present day sea-level and more are known to occur below.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Some, if not all, these caves, originated in two ways:
        </p>


        <ol>
            <li><b>Solution Cavities</b><br>
                Most of these formed as weak acidic ground-waters slowly reacted to the
                Gibraltar Limestone. Some caves developed along faults or major joints
                because these fractures facilitated ground-water movement, thereby rapidly
                removing the reaction products and introducing fresh acid into the rock's
                surface.
                Others developed within beds of dolomitic Limestone that occur within the
                Gibraltar Limestone succession. The mineral dolomite is more soluble than
                calcite and dolomitized Limestone tend to have a higher porosity (dolomite
                being denser than the original calcite from which it formed) thereby
                exposing a larger surface area of rock to the dissolving acidic
                ground-water. Most caves developed initially at horizons related to former
                relatively stable ground-water levels, because of the enhanced solution and
                frequent replenishment of acid within the zone of fluctuating water levels.
                These caves are controlled in part by the prevailing position of the
                sea-level and variations have occurred reflecting the various different
                sea-level stands that existed previously.
            </li>

            <br>

            <li><b>Sea Caves</b><br>
                Several levels of caves were eroded by marine action during times when
                sea-levels differed to those of today. Some are former solution cavities
                breached by the sea, but they indicate periods when sea-levels were stable
                enough for such erosion to take place. The most prominent and well
                developed caves of this kind are to the south and east of Windmill Hill Flats.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Commonly, most of the Gibraltar caves situated close to the sea, usually
            contain one or more characteristic sediments.
        </p>


        <h3>Flowstone layers</h3>

        <p>
            Strictly termed speleothem deposits, and often loosely termed travertine,
            For these to form the cave must be wet, so that calcium carbonate can be
            precipitated from acidified water carrying calcium bicarbonate dripping from
            the cave's roof, walls or floor as carbon dioxide within the water
            dissipates in the cave's air. Many of the caves in Gibraltar today are too dry
            for flowstone formation, yet the contents of this deposit are spectacular,
            sometimes buried beneath other sediments. These are indicative of periods
            of more humid climate in the past, such as climate encouraging growth of
            more vegetation than at present at ground surface, with the release of
            greater quantities of humic acid, thus enhancing the acidity of the
            percolating water necessary for the initial dissolution of the limestone.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The nature of the flowstone depends on the rate of flow of the water, the
            discharge point and the chemistry of the host rock. Magnesium-rich
            limestone, thus palettes of flowstone can be left behind as the
            dolomite-rich rock supporting them is dissolved away. If the water drips
            from the roof, stalactites can form with stalagmites growing on the cave
            floor beneath, cave columns developing when these two structures grow
            sufficiently to join together.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            However, flowing water tends to produce the sheet-like deposits properly
            known as flowstone, whereas slow seepage produces more delicate cave forms
            such as helictites (thin carbonate tubes), cave flowers (sprouting clusters
            of helictites) and cave shields (semicircular sheets of carbonate attached
            to fractures in the cave's walls)
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            If pools of water remain on the cave floor for long periods of time, special
            flowstone deposits can develop, notably calcite rafts (paper-thin sheets
            growing on the water surface which can develop into thick ledges at the
            waters edge) and moon milk (white paste formed by micro-organisms causing
            disintegration of the limestone wall rock)
        </p>


        <h3>Cave-earth</h3>

        <p>
            In some caves the surface deposits on the floor consist of a loose or damp
            semi-compacted red clay, usually soil transported into the cave by water,
            but sometimes with components of chemical weathering or of organic detritus.
            Such cave-earths tend to be fine grained, since large sediment particles
            tend to be filtered out though tight fractures and pore-spaces, and to be
            well stratified; in contrast to these caves, those with loose, unstratified
            cave-earths indicate the effects of wind deposition (and are suggestive to a
            more arid climate, of greater sediment availability through low sea-level,
            lower vegetation cover, or variation in global dust flux)
        </p>


        <h3>Cave breccias</h3>

        <p>
            These consist almost exclusively of angular pieces of rock identical with
            those in which the cave is situated, with no significant wear observed on
            the fragments. They must therefore, have formed from material detached from
            the walls and rook of the cave. None are forming at the present day, and
            the climatic conditions under which the formed must have been different from
            the other two cave deposits just described. Such breccias are thought to
            indicate physical weathering in the form of fresh fracturing, and developed
            best in a climate with frequent frosts.
        </p>


        <h3>Solution Cavities</h3>

        <p>
            These are the consequence of ground-water solution within the cave,
            weathering at cracks, and at soil deposits these cavities are nearly always
            in a dump and arid condition making the process of flowstone and other cave
            formations possible.
        </p>


        <h3>Faults, Joints, Fissures</h3>

        <p>
            The Gibraltar Limestone is almost everywhere fractured by faults, joints,
            fissures and fractures, these are most obvious in highly tectonized areas
            where brecciation also occurs, some tend to be discontinuous through the
            rock, whilst others continue into natural chokes, and physical access
            becomes impossible, very large fissures and fractures, however do occur
            inside the rock (these are sometimes situated at/or near tunnels, excavated
            after the 1900's) and many of these have served as passage-ways for
            ground-water movement, as indicated by solution widening and the coating of
            flowstone, and other cave formations.
        </p>


        <h2 align="center"></h2>

        <p>
            Gibraltar's caves are far and wide, and in many ways are connected to
            Gibraltar's history, some have served as gun-power magazines, or used to
            accommodate troops (Beefsteak Cave) others as war time shelters (Glen Rocky)
            or as peace time storage (Poca Roca) and some even as potential water
            reservoirs (Ragged Staff), whilst few have been the subject of
            excavations by archaeologists (Genista's, Devil's Tower, Gorhams) others are
            known as tourist attractions (St. Michael's).
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The most potential of the caves are;
        </p>

        <h3>Genista caves (Busk &amp; Falconer, 1865; Warren 1865; Brown 1867)</h3>

        <p>
            Earliest scientific cave exploration on Gibraltar began with the Genista
            caves, named after Captain Frederick Brome, Governor of the Military Prison.
            (The word Genista derives from the formal Latin name for the plant called
            <b>Broom</b> in English).
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            These caves were accessible from Windmill Hill, and yielded rich deposits of
            fossil bones, including those of bear, rhinoceros, aurochs, deer, ibex, wild
            horse, leopard, hyena and many other animals now extinct or no longer living
            on or near the rock, the most accessible of the Genista caves yielded human
            remains <b>found lying in every imaginable direction and position</b> (Busk 1869)
            illustrated and described the Genista's and many other Gibraltar caves as
            then known, and discussed their archaeological contents.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            (Gibraltar Schedule of Antiquities, 1947 (?)=a very unreliable source of
            information) infers that the Genista lies somewhere <b> in and under Genista
            Magazine (?) at Windmill Hill</b>, a very deep cave discovered by Brome in
            1862, yielded many human and animal remains, not completely excavated, the
            top cavern was blasted out into an ammunition store in 1895, during which
            operation, the entrance to the rest of the cave was lost.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Present day: Even though the Genista Cave's complex has been lost(?) inside
            the Lathbury Barracks, and opposite the Parade Ground, there stands a rock
            plaque (which appears to have been moved to its present position)
            indicating the existence these caves, however and because of the effects of
            weathering to the rocks surface, this plaque is hardly legible.
        </p>


        <h3>Devil's Tower Cave (Garrod &amp; others, 1929)</h3>

        <p>
            This famous rock-shelter overlooking the isthmus, from the base at North
            Front. It north-east corner has yielded a Neanderthal human skull ( a child
            aged around 5 years) and flint implements of Mousterian culture type.
            Deposits yielding these remains rested on a marine beach 8-9 meters above
            present sea-level. The vertebrate fauna, as reported by Garrod &amp; others,
            are indicative of a climate somewhat cooler and damper than at present, with
            ibex being frequent and the great auk and alpine chough also present.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Present day: Although called Devil's Tower Cave, this is not a cave in the
            full context of the word, butt a natural fissure within the rock. At
            present it is inaccessible, as it forms part of the north-east arial farm,
            situated opposite Devil's Tower Road, at the Eastern Beach Road junction.
        </p>


        <h3>Gorham's Cave (Waechter, 1951; Zeuner 1954; Zeuner 1958)</h3>

        <p>
            Records show that this important cave on the east side of the Rock of
            Gibraltar was formed during the main and late Monastirian sea-levels, a
            concept now known to be invalid.<br>
            In the present the cave has been the subject of re-investigation under the
            joint directive of Dr J Cook of the British Museum and Dr C B Stringer of
            the Natural History Museum in London.<br>
            Based on J.Cook's preliminary report, &aelig;this cave is a phreatic passage which
            formed part of a subterranean system in the Gibraltar Limestone and was
            subsequently exposed by the erosion and massive collapse which created the
            cliffs along this section of the coast'.<br>
            &aelig;Sediments within the cave appear to have accumulated without interruption
            during the late Pleistocene. It remains to be proved whether or not they
            rest on beach material deposited during the high sea-level of the Last
            Interglacial about 120,000 years ago, when sea-level is unlikely to differ
            greatly to that of present day. If so, the over-lying deposits, were laid
            down between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago during the period of fluctuating
            climatic conditions known as the Last Ice Age. More certain is the evidence
            that during the period represented by
            the cave fill, Gibraltar must have been part of the mainland with a broad
            coastal plain covered with dunes stretching in front of the site.<br>
            The sediments incorporate Middle and Upper Palaeolithic stone artefacts,
            large and small animal remains, coprolites (fossil excrement), marine and
            terrestrial mollusc shells, as well as charcoal and plant ash which are
            occasionally concentrated in a manner which suggests they are the remains of
            hearths. These indicate that the cave was initially occupied over a long
            period by people who used locally available pebbles and cobbles to make a
            range of stone tools which falls within the general category of &aelig;Mousterian'
            and elsewhere (Devil's Tower) are associated with Neanderthal skeletal
            remains (the well preserved adult Neanderthal skull found at Forbes Quarry
            in the North Face in 1848 and originally referred to, before the discoveries
            in the Neander Valley in Germany, as Homocalpicus, cannot be dated because
            no details have been preserved of its context). Some flint is known from
            the Gorham site, which must have been brought or traded from distant
            sources, possibly even across the straits from North Africa.<br>
            The presence of anatomically modern hunter-gatherers during the later
            Pleistocene is attested by the presence higher in the cave sequence of both
            large and smallstone blade industries based partially on imported flint.
            Burnt animal bones exhibiting butchery marks have been found in association
            with the stone tools throughout the sequence'.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Present day: Access to this cave is at present restricted. Only few
            personnel are allowed access, obtainable from the Gibraltar Museum, whilst
            conducting excavations with other relevant bodies.
        </p>


        <h3>St Michael's Caves (Shaw, 1953, 1955 a,b)</h3>

        <p>
            The most easily accessible and celebrated cave in Gibraltar is St Michael's
            Cave, a noted tourist attraction and with a chamber large enough to serve as
            a concert hall.
            Shaw (1955 a,b), provides an extensive account of the history of exploration
            of the cave and the numerous bibliographic references to it since its
            earliest citation by the Augustan geographer Pomponius Mela in 45 AD. The
            cave is now properly named Old St Michael's, to distinguish it from New St
            Michael's Cave discovered in 1942.
            During 1942, a tunnel was being driven into the largest chamber of the Old
            St Michael's Cave so that it could be used as a store with reasonable air
            ventilation. This broke into the system now known as New St Michael's Cave,
            which was controlled and looked after, until recently by the Royal
            Engineers. (Shaw's 1953, account provides the best description of the
            system). New ST Michaels' not only contains stalagmite formations rivalling
            those in splendour of Old St Michael's, but also has a lake some 30 meters
            long and up to 11 meters wide and 6 meters deep. One of its remarkable
            features is the size of the calcite ledges formed at the lake margin by
            deposition from the surface of calcium bicarbonate-saturated water.
            Access into this cave system tends to be hazardous and can only be visited
            with the assistance of a guide.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Martin's Cave, on a path leading off from the Mediterranean Steps on the
            Upper Rock was rediscovered by chance by an artillery soldier in 1821. Two
            ancient 13th century swords were found there. The cave, situated some 600
            feet (185m) above sea level, contains a thriving bat colony.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Poca Roca Cave, near the old Isolation Hospital on the Upper Rock, was
            prepared for use in 1789 as an emergency residence for the Governor of
            Gibraltar. It never needed to be used.
