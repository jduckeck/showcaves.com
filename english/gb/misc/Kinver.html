<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
The <b>Rock Houses</b> were built along <b>Kinver Edge</b>, an outcrop of
sandstone between Kinver and Wolverley, which was ideal to dig caves into the
rather soft rock.
The houses were built since the 18th century.
Each had a bedroom and a separate living area, the rooms have an average size of
9m&sup2;.
None had electricity, running water, or toilets.
At the peak the complex housed eleven families in cave homes dug in three levels
into the rock face.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The reason why the people lived underground is not completely clear.
Probably it was related to the growth of the nearby Hyde Iron Works.
The increasing number of workers caused a shortage of housing.
And it was rather easy and fast to build such an house, as no rocks were needed,
just a pick and a shovel to dig.
With the closing of the iron works in 1880 an increasing amount of houses were
abandoned.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The caves were still used during World War II, but in the 1950s, when life
became better, the last two families left.
A few years later the site was purchased by the National Trust.
It seems they left the place unchanged for almost half a century.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
Three houses of the lowest level were restored and opened to the public in the
1990s.
Later one home of the top tier was restored, originally run as a tea-room by the
Reeve family, it is again used as a tea room.
The latest addition was the restauration of the Martindale Caves with the
characteristic porch.
The front wall was needed to close the cave against the outside, so actually the
house once had one single wall with windows and the door.
The place in front looked like any other British house, with porch, a small roof
above the front dor, and a garden.
This porch was depicted on some postcards from the 1930s, which were the only
source after which the porch was reconstructed.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The houses were first mentioned in a description from 1777, at this time a
family already lived in such a house.
Much is unknown, and mixes with local lore.
So there is a story about an Augustine monk who had his hermitage here, at the
place today called <b>Holy Austin's Rock</b>.
The cave houses are mentioned by <b class="smallCaps">Sabine Baring-Gould</b> in
his book <b>Cliff Castles and Cave Dwellings of Europe</b>.
He also wrote a novel named <b>Bladys of The Stewponey</b> which takes place
here and at the Kynaston's Cave.
A movie from this story was filmed at the original places in 1919.
The movie does not exist any more, some scenes are preserved by the National
Film Archive.
</p>

<p class="indentedText">
The cave houses are located in the middle of the forest along the escarpment of
lower Triassic sandstones.
There are several groups of houses, beneath Kinver Edge there are Nanny's Rock,
Crow's Rock, Miller Lane, and Gibraltar.
The Kinver Ende houses have a car park nearby, which is signposted.
Another possibility is to start at the National Trust parking lot at the Compton
Road, 200m west of Kinver.
The walk to the outlook <b>Nanny's Rock</b> and back is about 4km long and
offers some of the best views in Staffordshire.
The trail runs on top of the westbound <b>Kinver Edge escarpment</b>.
