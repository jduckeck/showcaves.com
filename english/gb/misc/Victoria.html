        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            <b>Victoria Tunnel</b> was built around 1840 as an subterranean wagon-way, to
            carry coal from <b>Spital Tongues Colliery</b> to boats at the mouth of the
            Ouseburn on the Tyne, the Newcastle Quay.
            It was named after the popular, young Queen <b class="smallCaps">Victoria</b>.
            Messrs. <b class="smallCaps">Porter</b> and <b class="smallCaps">Latimer</b>,
            the owners of Spital Tongues Colliery, originally transported their coal on
            carts through Newcastle.
            This was unpopular with the Town Council and the inhabitants, and also it was
            expensive.
            So they decided to build a wagon-way, a sort of railroad.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The wagon-way was planned by <b class="smallCaps">William E. Gilhespie</b>, a
            local engineer and colliery viewer.
            Newcastle's Georgian bridge, opened in 1781, was a low stone bridge.
            Large sea-going colliers could not cross it, so it was necessary to transport
            the coal to the downstream side of the bridge.
            <b class="smallCaps">Gilhespie</b> first planned a surface wagon-way across the
            Town Moor, but he did not get the permission of the owners, and the lease would
            also have been too expensive.
            So he finally decided to build a tunnel.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tunnel was constructed by <b class="smallCaps">John Cherry</b>, a lead miner
            from Yorkshire.
            He was employed as a pitman at the Spital Tongues Colliery.
            The tunnel was cut through clay, which is not very stable.
            So the whole tunnel was walled with base courses of stone and a double brick
            arch.
            The stone and brickwork was made by <b class="smallCaps">David Nixon</b>, a
            local builder.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tunnel is 3,218m long and has an decline of 67.66m.
            This is very fortunate, as no horses or steam engines were needed.
            The full wagons were pulled downwards by gravity, hold by a rope attached to a
            stationary 40hp steam engine which was used to brake.
            At the lower end the coal was unloaded and the empty wagons were pulled back up
            to the colliery.
            The tunnel was originally 2.26m high and 1.90m wide, the wagons were built to
            utilise the full width of the tunnel.
            Up to 32 wagons could be handled in a train, with three trips per hour, and
            a Newcastle chaldron (2,693kg) of coal per wagon.
            This means the tunnel was able to transport almost 260 tons of coal per hour.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tunnel was used for 18 years, until 1860.
            The colliery had been bought by the Northumberland &amp; Durham District Banking
            Co., which got into financial difficulties and had to cease all business.
            The mine could not be sold, so it was closed and the equipment sold on a public
            auction.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            During World War II the tunnel was reactivated as an air raid shelter.
            Seven entrances to the tunnel were constructed leading steep down into the
            tunnel from all along its course across the city.
            Even the original entrance at Ouse Street was used, but this one was nearly
            horizontal and the ceiling very thin in the entrance area.
            Because of this a series of five sets of blast walls were constructed.
            The long tunnel provided seating for up to 9,000 people and bunks for at least
            500 occupants.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The tunnel was used for various short-lived uses, like a mushroom farm and an
            art gallery.
            During the last years the <b>Ouseburn Heritage Group</b>, a sub-committee of
            the Ouseburn Trust, occasional took a small number of people into the tunnel
            via its entrance on Ouse Street.
            Because of damage at the tunnel this became too dangerous and was suspended.
            The tunnel is closed at the moment.
            But the newest development is the grant of &pound;200,000 to the city council
            for its renovation by the Heritage Lottery Fund.
            With this money the tunnel will be repaired and reopened to the public, probably
            in mid 2009.
        </p>
