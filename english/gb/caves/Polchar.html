        <h2>History</h2>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <div class="foreignText">

            <p>
                Follow the road from Laide to Gruinard for about a mile, past the Sand
                House Self Catering Apartments on your right, and on a sharp bend in the
                road where it passes two houses. Just past this point a rise is topped
                and the road begins to go down to First Coast. There is a car park on
                the hill top and another 50 yards further on. Park in either one of
                these for the path begins between the two of them. A wooden stake with
                the word "CAVE" on it marks the path.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                In order to bring the picture alive I can do no better than to quote
                direct from <b class="smallCaps">William Jolly</b> as he writes in
                <b class="smallCaps">Dixon</b>'s <b>"Guide to Gairloch"</b>:
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                <em>
                    "A footpath leads down (to the left) ... and should be followed to the
                    beach. There, one of the old caves has been enclosed by a wall and put
                    under lock and key. It is regularly used as a chapel by the Free Church
                    [following the disruption of the church in 1843], and numerous
                    worshippers gather on Sabbath, and seated on the boulders that form the
                    pews, listen to sacred words and sing Gaelic psalms ... Close to this
                    is another ... It is the home of an old women of seventy, and a girl her
                    sole companion ... The fire is close by the door and the bed lies on the
                    ground on the right. The old dame seemed as bright as the sunshine when
                    we visited her this summer, and declared that though rough, the place was
                    more comfortable than it looked .. her Gaelic bible her only literature,
                    the wild rocks round, and the splash of the restless waves in her ear...
                    But this is not the place to enter into her story".
                </em>
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                <b class="smallCaps">William Jolly</b> did not write about it for fear of getting embroiled in
                local politics. But it appears that the widow, <b class="smallCaps">Isabella MacKenzie</b> of
                Gunn from Drumchork lived in one of them for several years with her
                daughter or granddaughter. In 1862 <b class="smallCaps">Meyrick Bankes</b> applied for a court
                order to evict Isabella from the Polachar Cave and in the 1871 census she
                is shown as a pauper living at Sand. By the time of the 1881 census she
                was living in Achgarve and it is unclear where she went from there until
                1892 when she was living in Dingwall and on the register of the poor. The
                sum of 1/6d was being paid from the parish of Gairloch to Dingwall on her
                behalf.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The cave has a 6 ft high drystone wall in front of the entrance with a
                doorway 4 ft wide. This enclosed the apron to the cave. The entrance is
                15 ft high 20 ft wide and triangular in shape. There is a smooth hard
                flat floor and after 30 ft the roof lowers to enter a second chamber 8 ft
                high and about 10 ft long, this then enters another chamber about 3 ft
                high which goes back for 10 ft and ends in a low crawl which may be worth
                digging. Between the first and second chambers there is a stal flow on
                the wall [photograph] and the floor is very muddy at this point.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                There are other small caves in the vicinity dotted along the coast,
                including a through cave, but nothing is as spectacular as this one.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Further along the coast towards Udrigle, between the grave yard and the
                jetty are a series of red sandstone cliffs about 30 ft high, which are
                very friable and they appear to be incapable of supporting a cave except
                for 2 small examples near the jetty. It is interesting to speculate
                whether in Mesolithic times these cliffs would have contained inhabited
                rock shelters.
