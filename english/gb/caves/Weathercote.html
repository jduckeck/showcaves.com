        <p>
            <b>Weathercote Cave</b> was renowned as a natural curiosity since the 18th century, and was accessible as a show cave until 1971.
            The entrance is a 20 m deep, large shaft or collapse doline, which is dominated by a waterfall entering at one end.
            So it is actually not a cave at all, it is a collapse of a mostly inaccessible water-filled cave system.
            Nevertheless, it called <i>the most breathtaking experience in the Three Peaks</i>.
            Not even lights are needed.
            Unfortunately it is not open to the public anymore.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            Enclosed by a substantial wall for security reasons, from the doorway in the wall a trail leads to the open shaft.
            The collapse doline is 61 m long, 15 m wide, and 30 m deep, with a 25 m high waterfall at the opposite side and one entering from the right side.
            Both waterfalls are active after heavy rains, during summer there is only one of them.
            At times of high water the shaft may fill to the rim and overflow down the valley.
            Above the waterfall is a massive boulder known as <b>Mohammed's Coffin</b>.
            A flight of 51 steps descends beneath a natural rock arch to the bottom of the shaft.
            From here several short cave passages start, both uostream and downstream, but all of them end in sumps.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave is part of the underground watercourse of <b>Winterscales Beck</b>.
            It springs on the lower slopes of Whernside.
            It first sinks at <b>Haws Gill Wheel</b>, about 1,000 m upstream of Weathercote Cave.
            Here it meets a major strike/slip fault, dropping dramatically in a 25 m waterfall.
            From Weathercote the main passage leads to <b>Jingle Pot</b>, another daylight shaft located 140 m down the valley.
            The next segment of the cave connects to <b>Hurtle Pot</b>, a further 200 m down the valley.
            According to legendy it is home to the <b>Hurtle Pot Boggart</b>, believed to drown his victims by puling them into the depths.
            The water finally reappears at <b>God's Bridge</b>, 1,300 m down the valley, from here the river is called <b>Chapel Beck</b>.
            However the passages are waterfilled and not accessible.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The connection between Weathercote and Hurtle Pot was confirmed in 1770, when a glove or bonnet (the stories differ) lost by a female visitor in Weathercote Cave was later retrieved from Hurtle Pot.
            The underwater connection with Jingle Pot was explored more recently in 1986 by the <b>Cave Diving Group</b>.
            While not completely explored due to the technical difficulties, the whole cave system was estimated to be 2,370 m long with a vertical range of 64 m.
        </p>

        <p class="indentedText">
            The cave was first described in detail by <b class="smallCaps">Richard Pococke</b> in 1751, see citation below.
            In 1781 it became well-known through the publication of <b class="smallCaps">John Hutton</b>’s <b>Guide to the Caves in the Environs of Ingleborough</b>.
            It was visited twice by <b class="smallCaps">William Turner</b>, the English Romantic painter, who made a number of sketches and painted a view from the bottom.
            The first time in 1808 he made a watercolour shortly thereafter of the view from the bottom which is at Graves Art Gallery, Sheffield.
            In 1816 he visited the cave again, conditions were exceptionally wet That summer, and as <b class="smallCaps">Turner</b> noted, the cave was full of water and the normally dry stream-bed at the right was in full spate.
            He made a sketch which was the basis of a studio watercolour "Weathercote Cave when Half-Filled with Water" which is at the British Museum in London.
            It was published in 1822 in <b class="smallCaps">Thomas Dunham Whitaker</b>’s <b>History of Richmondshire</b>.

            Leek, in Staffordshire,<br>
            June 4th, 1751.<br>
            On May 28th I went from Chapel Dale, at the foot of Ingleborough, across Tweeselton Scar, to the west, there being another rocky low hill running along the foot of Ingleborough, which is called Ingleborough Scar.
            We descended into King's Dale, in which there is only one house, and crossed to the west side of it, to Jardours Cove, to which there is an entrance, something like that of the Peke of Derby, but not so large ; it leads to a very grand high cave, the sides of which are smooth perpendicular rocks, about SO feet high, except in two or three places, where there are some curious incrustations made by the water.
            There is a small passage to the left, but what is most extraordinary, we went into the passage to the left between the rocks, through streams of water, and came to a cavern, where two or three streams come tumbling down the rocks with a great noise for ten or fifteen feet, and in other parts there are cupolas so high that we could not see to the top.
            I went up the hill, over it, and saw the stream come rushing down a great way over the rocks, with several litle falls coming out towards the top of the mountain, and it is lost in the ground near the place where we saw it come out in the cave ; both this rock and Weather Coat Cave abound in shells of the Conchae Anomiae.

        </p>

        <p class="foreign">
            As an example of a large, Nature-formed, abrupt, and profound hiatus in the rock, receiving a cataract of majestic proportions, it is a marvellous production, and is certainly without rival in England.

        </p>

        <p class="">
            The cave is located on private property and not acessible to the public.
            A few years ago the owner was even unwilling to allow cavers into the cave.
            The cave actually lies beneath the home of the owner, who is obviously not very fond about tourists invading his garden.
            The current owner is much nicer and allows visits after appointment a few days in advance.
            The site is quite dangerous, not only because of the possible rockfall, but also because the old stairs are partly destroyed and slippery.
            So we strongly recommend a helmet with headlamp and sturdy shoes or rubber boots, even if this is not actually a cave.

        <p class="indentedText">
            If you cannot see Weathercote Cave, we strongly recommend a visit to <b>Jingle Pot</b> and <b>Hurtle Pot</b>, the other two windows into the flooded cave system.
            Both dolines can be accessed from the lane behind St Leonard’s Church, at Chapel-le-Dale, no reservation needed.
