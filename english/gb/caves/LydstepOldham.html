                Mason describes these caverns in 1880 as only: "... four miles from
                Tenby, and can only be visited at low water and the spring tides... .
                After passing the village, you proceed down a lane about 274m towards the
                sea to Lydstep Lodge, thence along a trackway over the hill, from the
                summit of which there is seen, in the centre of a romantic and
                sequestered glen, the 'Guide's cottage', keeping close to which we walk
                down the bottom of the rocky defile, until, after passing over some
                fragments of rock, we arrive at the shore. The view on either hand is
                grand and beautiful in the extreme, but especially on the right, where a
                high cliff descends sheer as a wall to the sea, and is seen to great
                advantage through a natural arch, (see cover illustration) a portion of
                the nearest cavern ... It is only at the equinoctial spring-tides, and
                not always then, that the caverns to the extreme right and left are
                accessible; the rocks over which the explorer passes are, in the spring,
                crimson with the young fronds of 'Plocamium coccineum', and other
                'Rhodosperms'. The 'Laminaria' is covered with the pretty little
                pellucid 'Patella'; and many other shells., scarce at Tenby, are abundant
                here; the deep, clear, rock pools are miniature museums of animated
                nature; and the only regret of the gazer into their varied stores is,
                that he dare not begin to inspect them at his leisure, for the inexorable
                tide is fast cutting off his retreat. The cavern farthest to the west is
                one of the best - the prospect from it is magnificent; looking seawards
                from which, to the right, is an enormous cliff, rising nearly
                perpendicular from the shore; to the left the cliffs are precipitous,
                while the roof of the cavern is curiously perforated; the rocks below
                high-water mark are covered with seaweed, whose varied hues assist in
                adding a degree of enchantment to this pre-eminently picturesque and
                beautiful scene."
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Mason continues, speaking of Lydstep, " ... the fine coast scenery
                between Giltar Point and Skrinkle Bay should only be undertaken in very
                calm weather, as when it is unsettled heavy seas prevail. Mr. Gosse
                says: "once round Giltar, the coast becomes picturesque; the crags were
                fantastic, the precipices abrupt and sheer, and the shutting in and
                opening up of the little rocky coves every instant, as we sped along,
                gave a perpetual interest to the scene, changing it like a moving
                panorama. Caverns with funnel openings above were numerous, and there
                were many others deep, and highly picturesque, one in particular has
                received a name from its singular appearance; it is a yawning chasm in
                the face of the cliff, in the centre of which there is a most excellent
                image of the face of a colossal bear, as if crouching in the cave, with
                his nose on the water's edge. The pointed ears, the half-closed eyes,
                the nose and muzzle are all excellent, almost too good to be true; till
                on approaching, you discern that every feature is merely some natural
                crevice, or angle, or rounding of the wet and slimy rocks... ."
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                "Close to the right of Bear Cave, that is on your right as you look into
                it, stands a jagged peak in the sea, which is connected with the main
                natural bridge ... Beyond this we see a succession of arches, and caves,
                and flat-roofed rooms, perforating the foot of the cliffs ... One of
                these arches is named Rouse Hole ... The stratification is absolutely
                perpendicular, we are under Lydstep Head, 130 feet high ... Presently
                we come to the Droch, where a more majestic cavern than any we had yet
                seen appears. Upon a beach of yellow sand its immense span is reared,
                with a secondary entrance. The arch of uniting stone is thrown across
                with beautiful lightness, and it appears as if hewn with the mason's
                chisel. All the ledges are horizontal like courses of masonry; all the
                fissures vertical."
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Today Lydstep Caverns are owned by Lydstep Estate who run a holiday
                centre with restaurant, snack bars, shop, etc. An admission / parking
                charge is made for day visitors, but as the author was refused admission
                because he drove a van, an alternative free access route is suggested.
                Take the footpath which runs down beside Lydstep Post Office to Lydstep
                Haven and follow the right hand fork to the caves.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Smugglers' Cave consists of three entrances, and includes a karst window
                or skylight. It is a large sea cave about 300 feet long with an average
                passage cross section of 20 feet wide and 30 feet high. The upper end
                opens out into a grassy doline in which steps and hand rails were
                provided.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                On the same beach, but a little further to the west, is another cave
                called The Droch. Here, an entrance 20 feet wide and 50 feet high opens
                out into a chamber 60 feet wide and 60 feet high, a short distance along
                the coast again is a rift filled with Pleistocene material. The coast
                certainly lives up to its name, the 'Bay of Caves' as there are many more
                sea caves here which may also be visited, provided, of course, that you
                remember to bring a torch.
