            <h2 align="center">Show Caves of Belgium</h2>
            <h1 align="center">The Caves of Han and Rochefort</h1>
            <h2 align="center">by Anne Court</h2>

            <br clear="all">

            <p>
                The cave of Rochefort is rather overshadowed
                by the fame of the cave of Han, which is a mere
                four miles away. However, both caves are of considerable interest in
                their own way, Han with the
                river and beautiful stalactite formations, and
                Rochefort with attractions which are of a more
                rugged and majestic nature, incorporating narrow
                corridors and large boulder-strewn chambers.
                Possibly the most memorable feature of
                Rochefort are the 1,100 steps traversed by the
                visitor, or perhaps it is the enormous "Hall of the
                Sabbath", the largest chamber in the cave. In this
                vast cavity the visitor can sit in a natural subterranean amphitheatre
                and watch as the guide lights the flame in a hot air balloon which slowly
                ascends into the roof to a height of 300 feet.
                Visitors to the village of Han, intending to visit
                the Show cave, the second largest in Europe, will
                perhaps be surprised at the lack of signs, indicating the entrance to the
                famous show place. Unlike most show caves, where one purchases a ticket
                at the barrier and then passes into the cave, at Han, the tickets are
                sold at the palacial offices of the
                Societe Anonyme, in the market square of Han,
                whilst the cave is a few miles further up the
                hillside.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                A great clanking across the road from the offices
                announces the arrival of the tram, which ferries
                visitors to a point above the cave entrance.
                The trams are very picturesque, and, by British
                standards, more like something out of the Wild
                West, with the conductor leaping from coach to
                coach whilst the tram is in motion, to collect the
                fares.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The drive up the mountainside lasts about ten
                minutes, passing the river exit from the caves on the way. The tracks
                wind through quiet woodland and suddenly, as if in the middle of nowhere,
                the tram grinds to a halt. The passengers, who are met by the guide,
                alight and begin a leisurely walk
                down a steeply sloping path, through the woods to
                the cave entrance.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The entrance to the cave is very unimposing. At
                first glance it would appear to be only a rock
                shelter. It is said that in days gone by, saltpetre
                was extracted from the entrance chamber by the
                local inhabitants.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                A blast of cold air hits one upon stepping
                through the entrance into a large passage. Several
                very tight passages lead off, but these, are for
                cavers only and not visited by the public.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Excavations were carried out in the first three
                chambers of the cave by <b class="smallCaps">Edouard de Pierpont</b> in
                1902-1904, but unfortunately most of his finds and
                writings were destroyed during the war. The bones
                of cave bear were amongst the earlier deposits, and
                other remains included Neolithic, Bronze Age and
                Belgo-Roman artifacts. Today the cave contains
                the usual troglobitic flora and fauna. Ferns and
                mosses grow in the light of electric lamps and
                small animals feed on the visitors' refuse and hide
                under the rocks and in small pools.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Descending a rocky staircase, past the narrow
                entrance of the Gallery of Adventures, one enters
                the Hall of the Beetles. This chamber takes its
                name from the remains of the millions of beetles
                which fed on the carrion left by the foxes. The
                next chamber is the Hall of the Foxes, where many
                generations of foxes lived and died. The guide
                speaks of it in far more romantic terms: "Here
                the foxes had their Council Chamber".
            </p>

            <h2>Passages Named After Discoverers</h2>

            <p>
                Many of the passages and chambers are named
                after the people who discovered them, and accordingly
                the next chamber is known as the <b>Room of
                Vigneron</b>, after the guide who discovered it in
                1828. It is well decorated and contains a massive
                boulder ruckle which looks most unstable. During
                the wet weather this chamber is liable to flooding.
                The work of exploration in these caves never
                ceases, and as recently as 1962 there was a breakthrough
                into a new series which is already open to
                the public. It is obvious at once that one is
                entering into the new portion of the cave as the
                formations radiate with sparkling whiteness.
                The first chamber in the new series is known as
                the Hall of Cataclysms. In years gone by the
                boulder piles have shifted and consequently some
                of the formations have become broken and
                reformed into fantastic shapes.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Walking on, one enters a section of the cave
                known as The Forest. Here a route has been made
                under a veritable forest of stalagmites, thus preserving their beauty.
                The Forest is brought to
                light most realistically when viewed from the
                correct angle in a small pool of water. The
                formations become more and more lavish, one
                passes a tall crystalline "Waterfall" and then a
                most spectacular cluster of columns, averaging
                16ft. in height and sparkling white. There, is a vast formation 15ft. in
                height called the Minaret, with a small facsimile beside it. The roof
                towers above and the next chamber "The Hanging
                Gardens" really lives up to its name, for the
                ceiling is draped with stalactites and stalactite
                curtains, their voluptuous dimensions lost in the
                vastness of their surroundings. The most beautiful
                chamber in the cave is called "The Eastern
                Gardens", where the rock walls are hidden under
                varying shapes of dripstone formations.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Now the path re-joins the old cave in the Hall
                of Wonders. This really consists of three chambers
                merged into one. The dimensions are vast and the
                more notable formations include The Popes Tiara,
                The Mosque and the Alhambra Colonnade.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Suddenly, upon turning a corner one meets the
                River Lesse, poetically called The Styx. It takes
                sixteen hours to reach this point from the swallet
                of Belvaux, and a further eight hours to resurge
                near the tram track. When the snow melts, the
                river has been known to rise as much as 50ft.
                making parts of the cave impassable.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Walking along the riverside, one enters the
                chamber containing The Trophy. This is the
                largest formation in the cave, being 15ft. high and
                45ft. wide. The whole arrangement has been
                likened to the interior of a church, with the
                Trophy forming the Altar.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The party then steps from under a low arch into
                a vast chamber, 210ft. long. In the centre is a
                restaurant which can seat 500 people. Having been
                walking for about one hour, most people are glad
                of an opportunity to sit down and partake of a
                little light refreshment. It also gives one a chance
                to inspect the chamber at leisure, with the River
                Styx flowing silently by at one end. It is indeed a
                novelty to sit in comfort and be served quickly by
                pretty waitresses 520ft. under the earth.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Twenty minutes later the guide gathers his
                flock and the party passes on to the next chamber,
                the Cathedral Gallery, where even more surprises
                are in store. This is the largest hall with a ruckle
                of boulders against one wall stretching nearly to
                the roof. From the top of this boulder pile known
                as the Throne of Pluto, an assistant guide with a
                flaming torch leaps down from rock to rock. Only
                then does one fully appreciate the immense
                dimensions.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                Passing on from the Cathedral Chamber, it is
                possible to glance down into the Embarkation
                Hall, and soon the party reaches this point to set
                out on the river for the last part of the trip.
            </p>

            <p class="indentedText">
                The large, flat bottomed boats which carry
                about thirty people, progress in convoy down the
                silent river. Soon daylight begins to cast a blue
                haze on the water. Then comes the Piece de
                Resistance of this place of wonders. There is an
                ear-shattering roar as a cannon explodes at the
                entrance and the echoes boom into the distance to
                be replaced by a sharp twittering from above. This
                is made by a colony of bats hanging about 15ft.
                above, the water a few yards before the wide,
                arched water exit where the boat glides out into
                reality once again.
