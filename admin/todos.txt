Carbosulcis CO2 storage potential project
Carbosulcis S.p.A. is a coal mining company based in SouthWest of Sardinia, Italy. It  employs about 500 units in total in underground and surface activities, and is managed by the Sardinian Government since 1996.
The “Miniera Monte Sinni” Coal Mining Concession, the only active coal mine in Italy, exploits the Sulcis Eocenic Coal Basin, worth of 2.5 Billion tons of sub-bitumineous coal reserves for about 400 km2 of extent in-shore and about the same off-shore.
The amount of underground coal reserves in the 55 km2 mine concession is over 60 Mtons. The potential yearly u/g longwall production of the mine is 1.5 M tons of saleable coal.
Actually the mine depth is comprised between 350 and 500m underground, and its coal is burned by the ENEL Power Plant of Portovesme, located 3 km from the mine.
Carbosulcis S.p.A. promotes R&D activities, aimed mainly at optimising coal production processes, integrating mining production with the other activities of the power production cycle and opening new markets through studies and applications on advanced technologies, mainly related to CCS/ECBM applications in non-minable areas of the basin deeper than 700 m.
After a period of prefeasibility studies, Carbosulcis has held an international partnership of experienced members to deeply study the potentiality of deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies. In 2007 Carbosulcis obtained a Reseach Permission for Methane, Coal and Thermal Water in the on-shore south west area of the Sulcis coal basin. In March 2008 Carbosulcis and its partners started the Carbosulcis Project for CBM/ECBM and aquifers CO2 storage technologies.
This project is aimed at assessing coal properties in the deeper parts of the Sulcis basin (“Is Urigus” Research Permit) and is focused both to ECBM and saline acquifers storage technologies. It consists of:
campaign of more than 1000 m deep core drills;
samples analysis for physical-chemical properties assessment;
seismic campaign and modelling activities for reservoir characterization.
Finally, Carbosulcis is involved in the national programme  on CCS funded by Ministry of Economic Development.
All the planned activities are carried out in order to be fully compliant with EU proposed directive (23.01.2008 n.2008/0015).
