Other Tunisian places where the Seven Sleepers' cave is located are Mides, Tozeur, El-Oudiane (al-Udyān) and Talālat.
 According to the traveller Abu Salim al-Ayyashi (17th century), the place where they lie is a mountain over the village of Degache (which he calls Daqyūs)
Another place where popular beliefs locate the Seven Sleepers is Azeffoun, in Kabylia (Algeria), where a legend collected by Auguste Mouliéras  speaks of seven shepherds who fled into a cave trying to escape the persecution of Decius (Deqyus) and slept forty years there. According to this version, they did not realize that their sleep was so long (but a baker did, since they tried to pay him with an old coin), and decided to get back to sleep. Accordingly, they are reputed to be still sleeping, in a bush difficult to reach, "an hour's walk east of Azeffoun".  Their dog, watching over them, can be heard barking by passers-by.
A "mosque of the Seven Sleepers" also exists in the Algerian village of N'Gaous (Aures), but here the legend is somewhat modified, since the tradition speaks of seven people living there in historical times, who mysteriously disappeared and were miraculously found asleep many years later by the pious Sidi Kacem (d. 1623), who consequently ordered that a mosque be built in that place.
  It should be noted, however, that the mosque itself incorporates some columns of Roman age, with two inscriptions mentioning Trebonianus Gallus, the successor of Decius

The 7 sleeping people would still sleep near Azeffoun, in Kabylia
Another place where popular beliefs locate the Seven Sleepers is Azeffoun, in Kabylia (Algeria), where a legend collected by Auguste Mouliéras speaks of seven shepherds who fled the persecution of Decius (Deqyus) to go and hide in a cave where they will sleep for forty years. According to this version, when they woke up, they did not realize that their sleep was so long, but on their way to town, a baker familiar with their legend, discovered their secret as soon as they had handed him an old coin. of coins that dated from another age. Embarrassed, probably, to be in a time that is not theirs, they joined another cave located in a bush difficult to reach, an hour's walk east of Azeffoun ”, where they still sleep in this day. According to the same belief,

The Mosque of the Seven Sleepers in N'Gaous, in Aurès
A “mosque of the Seven Sleepers” also exists in the Algerian village of N'gaous (Aurès), but, here, the legend is somewhat modified, since the tradition speaks of seven people who lived there in historical times, who mysteriously disappeared and miraculously found asleep, many years later by the pious Sidi Kacem (died 1623), who, therefore, ordered that a mosque be built there. It should be noted, however, that the mosque itself incorporates some columns from the Roman era, with two inscriptions citing Trebonianus Gallus, Decius' successor.


The basement of Cerveny Kamen castle was built in the middle of the XVI century. They have six levels and are the largest in Europe.

Chuandong Tiankeng Scenic Area

Tianxing Bridge Stone Forest - Tianxing Cave
Tallinn is made up of various forms of stalagmites, forming towers.
Water is the soul of the scenic area.
The abundant flowing water here makes the scenic area full of aura.
The Baishui River rushes among the stone forests of Tianxing Bridge.
Tianxing Bridge, also known as Tiansheng Bridge, does not refer to the specific bridge in the stone forest, but the Baishui River flickers through the flowing stone forest.
Travelers walk through the stone forest, and the underground channel of the Baishui River is often beneath their feet.
Below the roads of the stone forest, there is often the undercurrent of the Baishui River.
Therefore, walking through the paths of the stone forest is like crossing a series of natural stone bridges.
According to surveys, the undercurrent of Baishui River at Tianxing Bridge is 1 kilometer long and 300 meters wide.
The Tianxing Bridge can also be called a long bridge with a length of 1 kilometer!
Walking on the winding stone path in the stone forest of Tianxing Bridge, you can hear the invisible but faint sound of gurgling water coming from under your feet from time to time, which is heartwarming.
In the middle of the mountainside of the Stone Mountain near the Tianxing Bridge Stone Forest, there is a cave called Tianxing Cave, which is the most beautiful cave among the many cave houses in Huangguoshu Scenic Area.
The stalactites in the Tianxing Cave are famous for their colorfulness.
The stones in the cave are all seven colors of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, blue and purple.
They have almost become a sensitive refracting mirror of the solar spectrum, concentrating the colors of nature in the cave.
When I was in the cave, I felt that there was a 25-meter-high natural stone pillar, the famous Sky Star Pillar, which directly supported the ceiling of the cave.
Around the stone pillars, there is a group of stones.
Each stone is very much like a blooming lotus, with different sizes.
If you tap it lightly, the lotus-shaped stone will make music with different tones, wonderful!

PEER KHO CAVE TEMPLE, Jammu
On Circular Road above the banks of river Tawi is another shrine of Lord Shiva where he is worshipped in the form of a Swayambhu Linga.
There is also a cave adjacent to the shrine known as Jambavanta cave.
It has been the belief of the locals since ages, that the great bear named Jambavanta, who played a key role in helping Lord Rama in vanquishing the demon Ravana in the epic Ramayana, had meditated in this cave for a long duration.
Being an easily accessible destination, the Peer Kho Cave Temple can be reached from central Jammu by covering a distance of mere 3.5 kilometres.
The presence of dense shrubbery and acacia trees render an out-of-the-world feeling to this place, and make the environment more suitable for God worship.

Shiv Khori Trek, Kotla 185201, Jammu
Katra also serves as the base camp for another noteworthy shrine.
Just 78 kilometres from Katra is Shiv Khori, a holy cave where a naturally formed Shivalinga is worshipped with great devotion by people.
Devotees travel from Katra to the village of Ransoo by buses or cabs, and then take a trek to the 150 metre long cave.
According to the local lore, thousands of years ago, at this very site, Lord Shiva confronted a nasty demon who had secured a boon of being invincible.
After killing the demon, Lord Shiva used his trident to cut the rocky mountain and paved way for himself to reach the holy shrine of Amarnath in Kashmir.
The sanctum sanctorum houses a 4 feet long Shivalinga along with a few naturally formed cave impressions depicting Shiva’s family: Goddess Parvati, Kartikeya, Ganesha and Nandi.
Interestingly, the inner chamber of the cave is divided into two pathways.
It is believed that a few ascetics in the past dared to tread the unknown territory in their bid to reach Amarnath Shrine, but they never returned.

Orzei Gorges in the Bucegi mountains, Romania.
https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheile_Orzei
Located north of Scropoasa Lake in the Bucegi Mountains , Orzei Gorges are among the narrowest, most beautiful and spectacular gorges in the Ialomița Valley and even in Romania . They stretch for a length of over 1.5 km, dug into limestone walls . In 1970 , in order to protect this valuable space, the Cheile Orzei Complex Natural Reserve was established [1] .
The mixed nature reserves Orzea - ​​Zănoaga and Zănoaga - Lucăcilă include the Zănoaga karst system: Cheile Zănoagei Mari , Cheile Zănoagei Mici , Cheile Orzei (natural monuments), spruce forests ( Pices abies ); a thermophilic vegetation composed of rare southern European, southern Mediterranean or Balkan floristic elements: mountain rye (Secale montanum), iris ( Iris dacica ), scurvy ( Sorbus cretica ), thorn ( Carduus candicanus ), umbelifera ( Athamantha hungarica ),thyme ( Phleum montanum ), honeysuckle ( Lonicera caerulea ), Cossacks ( Astragalus depressus ), etc.
A starting point for the gorges is the Vânători camp near Dobrești . Dobrești can be reached on the Târgoviște - Moroeni road .

Cave Chapel at Modderpoort Prior, near Ladybrand, Free State, South Africa

The Fox Glacier (Te Moeka o Tuawe in Māori) is a 13 km (8.1 mi) long glacier located in Westland Tai Poutini National Park on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island.
It was named in 1872 after a visit by the then Prime Minister of New Zealand, Sir William Fox
the Fox Glacer is only 25 kilometres from Franz Josef Glacier.
At 300 metres deep, and 13 kilometres long, Fox falls about 2600 metres throughout it's journey.

Finnich Gorge, Scotland. The gorge has its own micro-climate, being several hundred feet deep, with the sun rarely penetrating its depths except when it is directly overhead or at certain times of the year.
 When the early morning mist forms in the surrounding moors, it gets sucked down into the gorge and funnelled along its twists and turns.
  Deep in the gorge is the Devil's Pulpit, an altar place of worship for Celtic Druid priests.
   When the mist funnels through the gorge it is known as the Devil's Breath.

Sin Lae Yae Win Cave @ Sin Sar Pyar Village @ Shan State

Pyadalin Cave - Padalin Cave - Padah-Lin Caves, Ywangan
Pyadalin historical cave is an important archaeological site on the western slope of Shan State, Taunggyi district, near Ywangan Township.
This cave was firstly discovered by geologist U Khin Maung Kyaw  in 1960 and the “Stone Age” painting from 10,000 years ago
were first found in this cave.
This cave consists of one main cave and a nearby rock shelter where the paintings are.
The first excavations by the Government from 1969-1972 they found charcoal pieces which have been 13,000 years old.
The rock shelter is more interesting from an archaeological point of view.
Archaeological excavations revealed stone tools, as well as mammalian bones, mollusc shells and charcoal.
This cave system is more atmoshperic than the heavily touristed Pindaya Caves.
-
Padalin, prehistoric caves, 1 and 2 are situated on the western slope of Shan Plateau.
Ywangan Township, Pindaya District, Southern Shan State.
These caves are located at about 30.57 km west of Ywangan village and 6.43 km east of Kinder Dam.
The second one is located 100 yards from the first one. The rock paintings are seen in the caves.
There are the Stone Age paintings that date back 11,000 years and discovered in 1960.
The first one has 80 ft length. 20 ft width and 14 ft height.
At a height of 10 ft to 12 ft on the wall of Cave 1, 12 kinds of primitive paintings with carbon 13,400 years ago are found and it is supposed to be an abode of the Stone Age men lived.
Stalactite and stalagmite are formed by drops of lime water from the roof.
--
Pyadalin has two limestone caves only 30 m apart from each other and are mesmerising to explore. You will notice that the smaller cave looks like a rock shelter whereas the larger one is massive, containing nine chambers and three huge sinkholes that allow sunlight to shine the cave. These caves are the rarest evidence of prehistoric times and share an interesting history that dates back to the Neolithic era. You can find the earliest wall carvings on the surface of these caves along with primitively made weapons and tools.

KYAT CAVE
The mysterious Kyat Cave is known to attract tourists, thanks to its undisturbed surrounding and one-of-a-kind attraction – coffins of tribes. Apart from having limestone and dolomite formation, this cave houses several old wooden coffins that range from 2 feet to 15 feet long. It is fascinating that some of these coffins are placed in odd positions like in cave cavities. The villagers collect bat faeces here, something they have practising for thousands of years. And the best part is no one actually knows the actual depth of it.

Carbosulcis CO2 storage potential project
Carbosulcis S.p.A. is a coal mining company based in SouthWest of Sardinia, Italy. It  employs about 500 units in total in underground and surface activities, and is managed by the Sardinian Government since 1996.
The “Miniera Monte Sinni” Coal Mining Concession, the only active coal mine in Italy, exploits the Sulcis Eocenic Coal Basin, worth of 2.5 Billion tons of sub-bitumineous coal reserves for about 400 km2 of extent in-shore and about the same off-shore.
The amount of underground coal reserves in the 55 km2 mine concession is over 60 Mtons. The potential yearly u/g longwall production of the mine is 1.5 M tons of saleable coal.
Actually the mine depth is comprised between 350 and 500m underground, and its coal is burned by the ENEL Power Plant of Portovesme, located 3 km from the mine.
Carbosulcis S.p.A. promotes R&D activities, aimed mainly at optimising coal production processes, integrating mining production with the other activities of the power production cycle and opening new markets through studies and applications on advanced technologies, mainly related to CCS/ECBM applications in non-minable areas of the basin deeper than 700 m.
After a period of prefeasibility studies, Carbosulcis has held an international partnership of experienced members to deeply study the potentiality of deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies. In 2007 Carbosulcis obtained a Reseach Permission for Methane, Coal and Thermal Water in the on-shore south west area of the Sulcis coal basin. In March 2008 Carbosulcis and its partners started the Carbosulcis Project for CBM/ECBM and aquifers CO2 storage technologies.
This project is aimed at assessing coal properties in the deeper parts of the Sulcis basin (“Is Urigus” Research Permit) and is focused both to ECBM and saline acquifers storage technologies. It consists of:
campaign of more than 1000 m deep core drills;
samples analysis for physical-chemical properties assessment;
seismic campaign and modelling activities for reservoir characterization.
Finally, Carbosulcis is involved in the national programme  on CCS funded by Ministry of Economic Development.
All the planned activities are carried out in order to be fully compliant with EU proposed directive (23.01.2008 n.2008/0015).

In the Bourbon Tunnel of Naples you can also participate in an Adventure course with a raft in the flooded tunnels. (photo: www.galleriaborbonica.com)
In the complex of the Bourbon Tunnel there is also a "parking" of abandoned Vespas, as well as vintage cars and motorcycles preserved underground (photo: galelriaborbonica.it).

TURIN - For the siege of 1706 the Savoy wanted an underground city from the fortified Citadel to the royal residences, practically under the entire historic center. Three-level labyrinth, often still accessible from the private cellars of the old buildings (the "infernotti"), the best way to visit the city's underground is by the Pietro Micca Museum or with Somewhere tours.

FERMO - The jewel village of the Marca Fermana also boasts, a few steps from Pizza del Popolo, the complex of the Cisterne ROmane, an Augustan masterpiece among the largest in Europe: 30 large rooms with a barrel vault for a total of 2,200 square meters. More info on www.fermomusei, it, visits with Fermosterranea.it (photo: fermosostterranea.it)

SIENA - The "bottini" are the underground tunnels built in the 13th-15th century for the water supply in the Sienna subsoil. In the photo, the "fontanella" (Photo: from "Journey in Underground Italy", by Fabrizio Ardito, Giunti).
The tunnels extend for about 25 km and are mostly carved out of the rock. The walls are covered with incrustations and stalactites. According to legend, they would communicate with the mythical underground river sacred to Diana. Info and visits with Diana Siena (Photo: from "Journey into Underground Italy", by Fabrizio Ardito, Giunti).

CHIUSI - Also in Tuscany, the history of Chiusi is linked to the reign of the Etruscans, who under the king Porsenna, in 510 BC. C., even challenged Rome. You get to the underground city from the Civic Museum, with a large Etruscan well from which you can admire the Fontebranda lake, as well as many cinerary urns.

To see the Labyrinth of Porsenna, however, between narrow corridors and tunnels, you need to go to the Cathedral Museum. And go down this ladder. (Photo: Gilberto Maltinti)
